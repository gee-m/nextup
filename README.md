## Project Overview

**Task Tree** is a single-file, offline-first web application for hierarchical task management with dependency tracking. Built with vanilla JavaScript, it visualizes todos as an interactive graph where tasks have parent-child relationships, dependencies, and work-in-progress states.

**Core Philosophy**: Tasks exist within context - they have parents (larger goals), children (subtasks), and dependencies (prerequisites). The visual graph makes these relationships explicit.

**Tech Stack**:
- Pure Vanilla JavaScript (zero dependencies)
- SVG for scalable graphics
- HTML5 native interactions
- localStorage for persistence
- Single HTML file (~2350 lines)

**File**: `task-tree.html` - Everything in one file for portability

---

## Quick Start

1. Open `task-tree.html` in any modern web browser
2. No build step, no server needed - works offline
3. Data auto-saves to localStorage on every change
4. That's it!

## Complete Feature List

### 🚀 Multi-Project Support

**One Canvas, Multiple Projects**: Manage multiple independent task hierarchies on the same canvas

- **Root Tasks as Projects**: Each root task (task with no parent) is its own project
- **Independent Working States**: One task can be "working" per project simultaneously
  - Project A working on Task 1
  - Project B working on Task 2
  - Both highlighted and tracked independently
- **Unified Visual Workspace**: See all projects at once with clear visual separation
- **Shared Dependencies**: Can create dependencies across projects if needed
- **Ideal For**:
  - Personal kanban with multiple projects
  - Team dashboard showing multiple initiatives
  - Context switching between parallel work streams
  - Managing both long-term goals and immediate tasks

### ✅ Core Task Management

#### Adding Tasks
- **Root Task**: Type in input field, click "Add Root Task" or press Enter
- **Child Task**: Ctrl+Click on parent node
- **Test Checklist**: Click "🧪 Test Checklist" to load pre-built test scenarios

#### Editing Tasks
- **Rename**: Double-click task text to edit inline
  - **Multiline Editor**: Full-width textarea matches the rectangle exactly, resizes dynamically as you type
  - **Text Alignment**: Text starts at left edge (left-aligned) for natural editing
  - **Text Selection**: Text auto-selected on open for immediate replacement
  - **Save**: Press **Enter** or click outside to save
  - **New Lines**: Press **Shift+Enter** to create new lines - **newlines are preserved** after saving!
  - **Cancel**: Press **Escape** to discard changes
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Intuitive modern UX - Enter saves, Shift+Enter for newlines
  - **Blank Lines**: Double Shift+Enter creates visual spacing between paragraphs
- **Hide Node**: Shift+Double-click to hide the node within its parent (quick shortcut)
  - Only works for child tasks (can't hide root tasks)
  - Hidden nodes don't render but preserve their state
  - Click the parent's hidden count badge to reveal hidden children
- **Delete**: Left-click to select, press Backspace (or Alt+Click)

#### Text Truncation & Expansion
- **Smart Truncation**: Long task titles are automatically truncated with "..."
  - Only truncates if significantly over limit (more than 5 chars beyond threshold)
  - Example: 60-char threshold won't truncate a 65-char title (only 5 chars saved)
  - Simple "..." suffix in normal text color (no special styling)
- **Customizable Threshold**: Adjust character limit (10-100) via "Text Length" control in toolbar
  - Default: 60 characters
  - Setting persists across sessions
- **Node Sizing & Typography Configuration**: Centralized config in app state for easy customization
  - `charWidth: 8` - Pixels per character for width calculation
  - `nodePadding: 5` - Left/right padding inside rectangles (5px each side = 10px total)
  - `minNodeWidth: 80` - Minimum rectangle width in pixels
  - `fontFamily: "'Fira Code', 'Consolas', 'Monaco', 'Courier New', monospace"` - Beautiful monospace font stack
  - All parameters referenced globally via `this.charWidth`, `this.fontFamily`, etc.
  - Future: UI controls or JSON import/export for user customization
- **Click to Expand**: Click anywhere on a truncated node to expand to full text
  - Node immediately shows full title and resizes
  - Lock button 🔓 appears to the left of the node
- **Lock Button** (🔓/🔒):
  - Appears only on expanded nodes (positioned to the left, outside the box)
  - 🔓 = unlocked (will collapse when you stop working)
  - 🔒 = locked (permanently expanded)
  - Click to toggle lock state
  - **When Working**: Lock button visible but greyed out (disabled)
  - **Unlock Behavior**:
    - If node is selected → stays expanded
    - If node is NOT selected → immediately collapses to truncated
- **Auto-Expand on Working**: Tasks marked as "working" automatically expand
  - Lock button shows but is disabled during work
  - When stopping work: collapses if unlocked, stays if locked
- **Smart Sizing**: Node width adjusts dynamically based on displayed text
- **Smooth Animation**: Width changes animate with 0.2s CSS transitions

#### Multiline Text Support
- **Automatic Text Wrapping**: Long text wraps to multiple lines when exceeding max width
  - **Word Wrap** (default): Breaks on word boundaries for readability

- **Security**: Links open with `noopener,noreferrer` flags
- **Clean Text**: URLs stripped from visible text, shown only in badge

### 🔗 Relationships & Dependencies

#### Parent-Child Relationships
- **Main Parent**: Solid line with arrow showing direction (Parent → Child)
- **Other Parents**: Secondary parent relationships (multiple parents per task)
- **Create Child**: Ctrl+Click on parent node
- **Reparent**: Ctrl+Drag from parent to make target a child
  - Drag A → B makes B a child of A (drag direction = relationship direction)
  - Shows **green line** from source to target matching final arrow
  - Arrow direction: A → B (parent → child)
  - Release over target node to complete reparenting
  - **Multi-Source Reparenting**: If multiple tasks selected + Ctrl+Drag one of them
    - All selected tasks become children of the drop target
    - Example: Select B, C, D → Ctrl+Drag to A → B, C, D all become children of A
- **Create Child at Position**: Ctrl+Drag parent to empty space
  - Shows **blue line** from source to cursor + preview node
  - Preview node intelligently positioned in drag direction (avoids blocking cursor)
  - Creates new child task at exact cursor location
  - New task has empty name and immediately enters edit mode
  - Smart positioning: preview appears ahead of cursor based on drag direction
- **Delete Connection**: Click line to select (turns blue), press Backspace
  - Deleting parent-child connection makes child a root task

#### Dependencies
- **Create Dependency**: Alt+Drag from prerequisite (source) to dependent (target)
  - Drag direction shows dependency flow: A → B means "B depends on A"
  - Arrow direction matches drag direction
  - Uses `elementFromPoint` to correctly detect drop target during drag
  - Works correctly even when dragging far from source node
  - Visual: Dashed lines with arrowheads pointing from prerequisite to dependent
  - **Multi-Target Dependencies**: If dropping on a selected task with others also selected
    - All selected tasks depend on the source
    - Example: Alt+Drag A → (select B, C, D) → A must be done before B, C, and D
- **Delete Dependency**: Click dependency line, press Backspace
- **Cycle Prevention**: App prevents creating circular dependencies

#### Automatic Cleanup
- When reparenting A to parent B:
  - Removes B from A's dependencies (redundant)
  - Removes A from B's dependencies (would be circular)

### 🎨 Visual Features & UI

#### Node Interaction
- **Drag Node**: Click and drag (no modifier keys)
- **Drag Subtree**: Shift+Drag parent to move entire tree together
- **Select Node**: Left-click (highlights blue)
- **Context Menu**: Right-click for options menu with emoji icons:
  - ➕ Add Child
  - ✅ Mark Done / ⏸️ Mark Pending
  - ▶️ Start Working / ⏹️ Stop Working
  - 👁️ Show / 🙈 Hide (if task has a parent - hides the node itself)
  - 📂 Show Children / 📦 Hide Children (if task has children - hides all children)
  - 📋 Copy Text (copies task title to clipboard)
  - 🗑️ Delete
- **Hover Effect**: Nodes get thicker border on hover

#### Line Interaction
- **Easy Click Detection**: Wide invisible hit zones (15px) for all lines
- **Hover Effect**: All lines turn blue on hover
- **Selection**: Click line turns it blue with glow
- **Deletion**: Select line, press Backspace

#### Visibility Management
- **Auto-Collapse**: When task + all children are done AND parent is done, task hides
  - Root tasks (no parent) are NEVER auto-hidden, even if completed
  - Only processes the clicked task and its relationships
  - Only applies after marking a task complete/incomplete
  - **Configurable**: Toggle "Auto-Hide Completed Nodes" in ⚙️ Settings
- **Manual Toggle**: Click red +N badge to show/hide children
- **Hidden Badge**: Shows count of hidden children
- **Smart Logic**:
  - Never auto-hides root tasks
  - Never auto-hides tasks inside non-completed parents
  - Respects manual hiding - won't auto-collapse if children are manually hidden

#### Canvas Controls
- **Pan Canvas**: Click and drag on empty space
- **Zoom In**: Ctrl++ or click 🔍+ button
- **Zoom Out**: Ctrl+- or click 🔍− button
- **Reset Zoom**: Ctrl+0

- **Right-click node**: "📋 Paste as Child (N nodes)" - pastes as child of clicked node
- **Keyboard**: Press Ctrl+V (⌘+V on Mac) - pastes at viewport center
- **Smart positioning**: Children maintain relative positions from original

**Sharing with Peers**:
1. Copy subtree (JSON automatically in system clipboard)
2. Paste into Slack, email, or text file
3. Colleague copies JSON
4. Colleague opens Task Tree → Right-click empty space → "Paste Subtree Here"
5. Subtree appears perfectly!

#### Clipboard Format

```javascript
{
    version: "1.0",           // Format version for future compatibility
    subtree: [                // Array of task objects
        {
            id: 5,            // Original ID (remapped on paste)
            title: "Task",
            x: 100, y: 200,   // Relative positions
            mainParent: null, // null for subtree root
            children: [6, 7], // IDs within subtree
            dependencies: [], // Only internal dependencies
            status: "pending",
            currentlyWorking: false,  // Always false
            // ... other properties
        }
        // ... more tasks
    ],
    rootId: 5,               // Which task is the subtree root
    metadata: {
        copiedAt: 1234567890,    // Timestamp
        nodeCount: 5,             // Total nodes
        originalRoot: "Task Name", // For display
        appVersion: "1.16.0"      // App version
    }
}
```

#### Features

- **ID Remapping**: All task IDs are regenerated on paste to avoid conflicts
- **Relationship Preservation**: Parent-child links, dependencies maintained within subtree
- **External Cleanup**: Dependencies to external tasks are removed
- **Undo/Redo Support**: Copy/paste operations fully undoable
- **Multiple Paste**: Paste same subtree multiple times with unique IDs
- **Working State Protection**: Never copies `currentlyWorking: true` (prevents corruption)

#### Use Cases

1. **Templating**: Copy common task structures (e.g., "Sprint Planning" → paste for each sprint)
2. **Team Sharing**: Share project templates via Slack/email
3. **Duplication**: Duplicate complex subtrees instead of recreating manually
4. **Reorganization**: Copy subtree → paste in new location → delete original

### 🎯 Advanced Features

#### Undo/Redo System
- **Comprehensive History**: All operations are undoable - task creation, editing, deletion, status changes, moving, dependencies, imports, and even "Clear All Data"
- **Smart Edit Grouping**: Sequential edits to the same task within 2 seconds are grouped into a single undo step (prevents character-by-character undo)
- **Configurable History Limit**: Customize undo history size (5-200 steps) via Settings → Max Undo History
  - Default: 50 steps (automatically trims oldest when exceeded)
  - Lower values save memory, higher values provide deeper history
  - Changes apply immediately and trim excess history if needed
- **Clear History Button**: Manual history clearing in Settings → History Management
  - Shows current undo/redo counts and memory usage estimate
  - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental clearing
  - Frees up localStorage space when needed
- **Persistent History**: Undo/redo stacks saved to localStorage and restored on page reload
- **Toast Notifications**: Shows what was undone/redone with action descriptions (truncated at 50 chars)
- **Snapshot-Based**: Uses deep cloning of entire task array for reliable state restoration
- **Operations Tracked**:
  - Task creation (root, child, Ctrl+Click, right-click menu)
  - Task deletion (with task title shown)
  - Task editing (with smart 2-second grouping)
  - Status changes (pending/working/done)
  - Hide/show children
  - Drag operations (move task, move subtree) - NOT canvas panning
  - Dependencies (add/remove with both task names)
  - Copy/paste subtree (shows node count)
  - Import JSON (shows task count)
  - Clear All Data
- **Viewport vs Content**: Canvas panning is NOT undoable - it's viewport navigation, not content modification
  - Prevents accidental redo stack clearing when looking around
  - You can undo, pan to inspect, then redo without losing redo history
- **Storage Quota Handling**: Automatically trims history to last 10 steps if localStorage quota exceeded
- **Circular Prevention**: `isUndoing` flag prevents recursive snapshots during undo/redo operations

#### Modifier Key Behaviors
| Action | Modifier | Visual Feedback |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Create child | Ctrl+Click | - |
| Delete node | Alt+Click | - |
| Drag node | None | Moves single node |
| Drag subtree | Shift+Drag | Moves all descendants together |
| Reparent task | Ctrl+Drag | Green solid line preview |
| Create dependency | Alt+Drag | Blue dashed line preview |
| Cycle status | Middle-click | Status changes immediately |

  - Relationship management (lines 1291-1630)
  - Rendering engine (lines 1631-2290)
  - Persistence (lines 2293-2331)
```

### ⚙️ Configuration Pattern (READ THIS BEFORE ADDING FEATURES)

**RULE**: Any user-customizable parameter MUST be added to the `app` state object as a property, NOT hardcoded in functions.

**Why**: Single source of truth enables future UI controls, JSON import/export, and user customization without code changes.

**Current Configuration Parameters** (lines 761-766):
```javascript
// In app state object:
textLengthThreshold: 60,  // Character limit for truncation
charWidth: 8,             // Pixels per character for width calculation
nodePadding: 5,           // Left/right padding inside rectangles
minNodeWidth: 80,         // Minimum rectangle width
fontFamily: "'Fira Code', 'Consolas', 'Monaco', 'Courier New', monospace",  // Font stack for task text
fontWeight: 500           // Font weight: 400=normal, 500=medium, 600=semibold, 700=bold
```

**How to Add New Customizable Parameter**:
1. Add to `app` state object (around line 760) with clear comment
2. Replace ALL hardcoded uses with `this.parameterName`
3. Document here in this section
4. Add to CLAUDE.md configuration examples
5. Consider adding UI control in future

**Examples of what should be configurable**:
- ✅ Visual sizing (charWidth, padding, minWidth)
- ✅ Text thresholds (textLengthThreshold)
- ✅ Typography (fontFamily, fontWeight)
- ✅ UI preferences (darkMode)
- ✅ Zoom settings (zoomLevel, minZoom, maxZoom)
- ❌ Fixed constants (rectHeight: 40, always stays 40)

**Anti-pattern** (DON'T DO THIS):
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Hardcoded in function
const padding = 5;
const charWidth = 7;
```

**Correct pattern** (DO THIS):
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Reference app state
const padding = this.nodePadding;
const charWidth = this.charWidth;
```

### ⚙️ Settings UI

**Access**: Click the "⚙️ Settings" button in the toolbar

The Settings modal provides a user-friendly interface to customize all configuration parameters without editing code:

**Available Settings**:
- **Text Truncation Length** (20-200): Characters before text is truncated with "..." (default: 80)
- **Character Width** (4-15px): Pixels per character for node width calculation (default: 8.5)
- **Node Padding** (0-50px): Left/right padding inside task rectangles (default: 30)
- **Minimum Node Width** (40-200px): Minimum rectangle width regardless of text length (default: 100)
- **Enable Multiline Text**: Toggle multiline text support (default: enabled)
- **Max Node Width** (100-2000px): Maximum node width before text wraps to next line (default: 600)
- **Max Node Height** (0-1000px): Maximum node height in pixels, 0 = unlimited (default: 0)
- **Line Height** (12-40px): Vertical spacing between lines in pixels (default: 20)
- **Word Wrap Mode**: Wrap on word boundaries (enabled) vs character boundaries (disabled) (default: enabled)
- **Arrow Style**: Choose between Straight (default) or Curved arrow paths
- **Arrow Curvature** (0.05-0.5): Intensity of curve for curved arrows - 0.05 = subtle, 0.5 = dramatic (default: 0.25)
- **Font Family**: CSS font stack (default: Fira Code with monospace fallbacks)
- **Font Weight**: Text weight from Light (300) to Bold (700)
- **Show Delete Confirmation**: Toggle confirmation dialog when deleting tasks (default: enabled)
- **Auto-Hide Completed Nodes**: Automatically hide child nodes when they and their parent are marked done (default: enabled)
- **Max Undo History** (5-200): Maximum number of undo steps to keep in history (default: 50)
  - Higher values use more memory but provide deeper history
  - Excess snapshots automatically trimmed when limit is reduced

**Features**:
- ✨ **Live Preview**: Changes apply immediately when you click "Apply"
- 💾 **Auto-Save**: Settings persist to localStorage automatically
- 🔄 **Reset to Defaults**: "Reset to Defaults" button restores original values
- 📋 **Dynamic Form**: Form is generated automatically from configuration metadata
- 📜 **History Management**: Dedicated section showing undo/redo stats
  - Live display of undo step count vs limit (e.g., "15 / 50")
  - Redo step count
  - Estimated memory usage in KB
  - Clear History button to manually free up storage space
  - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental clearing

**Implementation Details**:
- `showSettingsModal()` - Dynamically generates form from config metadata, updates history stats display, adds ESC/click-outside handlers
- `hideSettingsModal()` - Closes modal and cleans up event listeners
- `applySettings()` - Reads form values, updates app state, enforces undo limit, re-renders, saves
- `resetSettings()` - Restores default values with confirmation dialog
- `exportSettings()` - Copies current settings as JSON to clipboard
- `clearUndoHistory()` - Clears all undo/redo history with confirmation, updates stats display
- `enforceUndoLimit()` - Trims undo stack to maxUndoSteps when limit is exceeded or changed
- Configuration metadata in `configDefs` object defines labels, types, ranges, descriptions

**User Interaction**:
- **ESC Key**: Press Escape to close without saving
- **Click Outside**: Click modal backdrop to cancel
- **Export Settings**: Copies clean JSON of current settings for easy sharing with others

**How Settings Are Stored**:
Settings are saved as part of the app state in localStorage. When you export tasks via "Export JSON", configuration values are included, allowing you to share customized appearances.

### Key Functions

**Task Management**:
- `addRootTask()` - Create top-level task
- `addChildTask(parentId)` - Create child of existing task
- `deleteTask(taskId)` - Remove task and cleanup relationships
- `cycleTaskStatus(taskId)` - Pending → Working → Done → Pending
- `startEditing(taskId)` / `finishEditing()` - Inline text editing

**Relationships**:
- `addDependency(fromId, toId)` - Create dependency with cycle check
- `removeDependency(fromId, toId)` - Remove dependency
- `reparentTask(childId, newParentId)` - Change parent with cleanup
- `wouldCreateCycle(fromId, toId)` - Prevent circular dependencies
- `getAncestors(taskId)` - Get all parents up to root
- `getDescendants(taskId)` - Get all children recursively

**Visibility**:
- `toggleHidden(taskId)` - Show/hide subtree
- `autoCollapseCompleted(task)` - Smart auto-collapse logic
- `getHiddenChildrenCount(taskId)` - Count for badge

**Notifications**:
- `showToast(message, type, duration)` - Show non-blocking toast notification
  - Types: `'success'` (green), `'error'` (red), `'info'` (blue)
  - Duration: milliseconds (default 4000)
  - Auto-dismisses and is clickable to dismiss early
  - Usage: `this.showToast('Operation completed!', 'success')`
- `showAlert(title, message)` - Show blocking modal (for critical messages)
- `showConfirm(title, message, callback)` - Show confirmation dialog

**Rendering**:
- `render()` - Main render loop (lines 2014-2205)
  - Applies zoom via SVG viewBox
  - Renders links (parent, dependency, other-parent)
  - Renders nodes with status classes
  - Handles editing mode with foreignObject input
  - Adds hidden children badges
- `updateStatusBar()` - Status bar content and visibility
- `createLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, classes)` - SVG line helper

**Coordinate System**:
- `getSVGPoint(event)` - Convert client coordinates to SVG space
  - Uses `getScreenCTM().inverse()` for proper transformation
  - Critical for accurate clicks at any zoom level

**Mouse Interactions**:
- `onCanvasMouseDown(e)` - Initiates drag modes, early return for lines
- `onCanvasMouseMove(e)` - Updates positions during drag
- `onCanvasMouseUp(e)` - Completes drag, creates relationships

**Persistence & Performance**:
- `saveToStorage()` - Serialize app state to localStorage (lines 4880-4930)
  - Saves all tasks, undo/redo stacks, settings, homes
  - Handles QuotaExceededError by trimming undo history
  - Called immediately after most operations
- `debouncedSaveToStorage(delay)` - Debounced save for frequent operations (lines 4862-4878)
  - Used for canvas panning to prevent performance issues
  - Waits `delay` ms after last call before saving (default 500ms)
  - Prevents excessive localStorage writes during rapid interactions
  - ~95% reduction in saves during panning operations
- `loadFromStorage()` - Restore app state from localStorage
  - Handles missing/corrupted data gracefully with defaults

**Selection**:
- `selectNode(taskId)` - Select node, uses requestAnimationFrame to defer render
- `deleteLine(lineObj)` - Delete selected line (parent or dependency)

### Transform-Based Rendering Architecture

**Why Transform-Based Positioning?**

The app uses SVG `<g transform="translate(x, y)">` groups instead of absolute positioning on individual elements. This enables:
- **GPU-accelerated animations**: CSS transitions on `transform` are hardware-accelerated
- **Smooth navigation**: Nodes slide smoothly when jumping between Homes
- **Proper SVG patterns**: Standard approach for grouping and positioning SVG elements

**How It Works**:

Each task node is wrapped in a `<g>` element with a transform:
```svg
<g class="task-node" data-id="5" transform="translate(500, 300)">
  <rect x="-50" y="-20" width="100" height="40" />  <!-- Relative to group center -->
  <text x="0" y="5">Task Name</text>  <!-- Relative to group center -->
</g>
```

**Animation Implementation**:

When jumping to a Home, a cinematic 3-phase animation plays (1.3 seconds total):
1. **Phase 1 (300ms)**: Zoom out to overview level using requestAnimationFrame
2. **Phase 2 (500ms)**: Add `.animating-view` class and update node transforms
   - CSS applies `transition: transform 0.5s` to smoothly pan nodes
   - Lines fade out via `opacity: 0` (CSS transitions don't work on SVG line attributes)
   - Stays at overview zoom for spatial context
3. **Phase 3 (500ms)**: Zoom in to target zoom level using requestAnimationFrame
4. After completion: remove `.animating-view` class and re-render with perfect arrows

**Technical Limitation**:

SVG line attributes (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are XML attributes, not CSS properties, so `transition: x1 0.5s` is ignored by browsers. The professional solution is to fade lines out during position changes and fade them back in afterward.

**Location in Code**:
- Transform-based node rendering: lines 3397-3634 in task-tree.html
- Animation CSS: lines 666-681
- `jumpToHome()` animation logic: lines 4206-4245

### Important Patterns

**SVG Event Handling**:
```javascript
// Two-layer approach for lines:
// 1. Invisible wide line for easy clicking (15px, pointer-events: stroke)
// 2. Visible thin line for display (2px, pointer-events: none)
// CSS: .hit-line:hover + .visible-line { style changes }
```

**Render Deferral**:
```javascript
// Defer render to prevent breaking double-click detection
selectNode(taskId) {
    this.selectedTaskId = taskId;
    requestAnimationFrame(() => this.render());
}
```

**Click vs Drag**:
```javascript
// Store original position on mousedown
// On mouseup: if distance < 5px → click, else → drag
const dist = Math.hypot(e.clientX - startX, e.clientY - startY);
if (dist < 5) handleClick();
```

**Zoom Implementation**:
```javascript
// SVG viewBox approach (not CSS transform)
const viewBoxWidth = this.viewBox.width / this.zoomLevel;
svg.setAttribute('viewBox', `${x} ${y} ${viewBoxWidth} ${viewBoxHeight}`);
```

## Future: Server Sync & Shared Graphs

### Current Architecture
- **Single HTML file**: Runs 100% client-side, zero dependencies
- **localStorage**: All data stored in browser only
- **No backend**: Completely offline-capable
- **Single-user**: Each browser has its own isolated graph

### Proposed: Multi-Mode Storage System

Allow users to choose between **Local Mode** (current) and **Server Mode** (shared graphs accessible via URL).

**Use Cases:**
- **Local Mode**: Personal task management, privacy-focused, works offline
- **Server Mode**: Team collaboration, access from multiple devices, shareable via URL
- **No authentication**: Simple shared access, anyone with URL can view/edit

---

### Option 1: REST API Server (Recommended)

**Effort:** ~6-8 hours development + minimal server setup
**Cost:** $0-5/month (free tier or minimal hosting)
**Complexity:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆ Medium

#### Architecture

```
Client (task-tree.html)
    ↓ HTTP requests
Server (Node.js + Express)
    ↓ File system
JSON files (graphs/project-name.json)
```

#### Server Implementation (~100-150 lines)

**Minimal Node.js + Express server:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));

// GET /api/graph/:id - Load graph
app.get('/api/graph/:id', (req, res) => {
  const path = `./graphs/${req.params.id}.json`;
  if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
    res.json(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path)));
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Graph not found' });
  }
});

// POST /api/graph/:id - Save graph (auto-saves with debounce)
app.post('/api/graph/:id', (req, res) => {
  const path = `./graphs/${req.params.id}.json`;
  fs.writeFileSync(path, JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
  res.json({ success: true, timestamp: Date.now() });
});

// GET /api/graphs - List all graphs
app.get('/api/graphs', (req, res) => {
  const files = fs.readdirSync('./graphs')
    .filter(f => f.endsWith('.json'))
    .map(f => ({ id: f.replace('.json', ''),
                 modified: fs.statSync(`./graphs/${f}`).mtime }));
  res.json(files);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

#### Client Changes (~250 lines)

**1. Storage Abstraction Layer:**

```javascript
// Add to app state
storageMode: 'local',           // 'local' or 'server'
serverUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
graphId: 'default',
autoSaveDelay: 2000,            // Debounce server saves (2 seconds)
saveTimeout: null,
lastServerSync: null,

// Abstract save method
async saveData() {
  if (this.storageMode === 'local') {
    this.saveToStorage();       // Current localStorage implementation
  } else {
    this.debouncedServerSave(); // New server save
  }
}

// Debounced server save (prevents spam on every keystroke)
debouncedServerSave() {
  clearTimeout(this.saveTimeout);
  this.saveTimeout = setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${this.serverUrl}/graph/${this.graphId}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          tasks: this.tasks,
          taskIdCounter: this.taskIdCounter,
          darkMode: this.darkMode,
          zoomLevel: this.zoomLevel,
          // ... all other persisted state
        })
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        this.lastServerSync = Date.now();
        this.showToast('✓ Synced to server', 'success', 2000);
      } else {
        throw new Error('Server returned error');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      this.showToast('⚠ Server sync failed - using local storage', 'error');
      this.saveToStorage(); // Fallback to localStorage
    }
  }, this.autoSaveDelay);
}

// Abstract load method
async loadData() {
  if (this.storageMode === 'local') {
    this.loadFromStorage();     // Current localStorage implementation
  } else {
    await this.loadFromServer();
  }
}

async loadFromServer() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.serverUrl}/graph/${this.graphId}`);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Graph not found');

    const data = await response.json();
    this.tasks = data.tasks || [];
    this.taskIdCounter = data.taskIdCounter || 0;
    // ... restore all state

    this.lastServerSync = Date.now();
    this.showToast('✓ Loaded from server', 'success', 2000);
  } catch (error) {
    this.showToast('⚠ Server load failed - using local storage', 'error');
    this.loadFromStorage(); // Fallback to localStorage
  }
}
```

**2. URL Parameter Support:**

```javascript
// On app init, check URL for graph parameter
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
if (urlParams.has('graph')) {
  this.graphId = urlParams.get('graph');
  this.storageMode = 'server';
  // URL: task-tree.html?graph=my-project
}
```

**3. Settings UI Updates:**

```javascript
// Add to configDefs in Settings modal
storageMode: {
  label: 'Storage Mode',
  type: 'select',
  default: 'local',
  options: [
    { value: 'local', label: 'Local (Browser Only)' },
    { value: 'server', label: 'Server (Shared)' }
  ],
  description: 'Local = localStorage, Server = shared via URL'
},

serverUrl: {
  label: 'Server URL',
  type: 'text',
  default: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
  description: 'API endpoint (only used in Server mode)'
},

graphId: {
  label: 'Graph ID',
  type: 'text',
  default: 'default',
  description: 'Graph name on server (e.g., "my-project")'
}
```

**4. Replace All Save Calls:**

```javascript
// Find/replace throughout codebase:
this.saveToStorage();
// With:
this.saveData();

// Current locations: ~25 calls across all operations
```

#### User Experience

**Local Mode (current behavior):**
```
- Open task-tree.html
- All data in browser localStorage
- No internet required
- Private to this browser
```

**Server Mode:**
```
1. Setup: Enter server URL in Settings (one-time)
2. Choose graph ID (e.g., "team-roadmap")
3. Click "Apply" → loads from server
4. Make changes → auto-saves to server (2-second debounce)
5. Share URL: task-tree.html?graph=team-roadmap
```

**Conflict Handling:**
- **Last-write-wins**: Simple, no merge conflicts
- Future: Add timestamp comparison, show warning if server version is newer

#### Deployment Options

| Platform | Cost | Setup Time | Pros |
|----------|------|------------|------|
| **Localhost** | Free | 1 min | Development, no public access |
| **Railway** | $5/mo | 5 min | Easy deploy, automatic HTTPS |
| **Heroku** | $5/mo | 10 min | Reliable, well-documented |
| **DigitalOcean** | $5/mo | 15 min | Full control, SSH access |
| **Vercel (serverless)** | Free | 5 min | Zero config, automatic scaling |
| **Netlify Functions** | Free | 5 min | Integrated with static hosting |

**Recommended:** Start with **Vercel** or **Railway** for simplicity.

#### Pros & Cons

✅ **Pros:**
- Full control over data and server
- Simple sharing via URL parameter
- Works on local network (no cloud required)
- Easy to extend (add auth, versioning, search later)
- Fallback to localStorage if server unavailable

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Requires server deployment and maintenance
- Need internet connection for server mode
- No built-in conflict resolution (last-write-wins)
- Server costs ($0-5/month)

---

### Option 2: GitHub Gist as Backend (No Server Required!)

**Effort:** ~3-4 hours development
**Cost:** $0 (free forever)
**Complexity:** ⭐☆☆☆☆ Low

#### Architecture

```
Client (task-tree.html)
    ↓ GitHub API (HTTPS)
GitHub Gist (public/private)
    ↓ JSON file storage
```

#### Implementation (~150 lines)

```javascript
// Add to app state
storageMode: 'local',           // 'local' or 'gist'
gistId: null,                   // e.g., 'abc123def456789'
githubToken: null,              // Optional for auto-save

async loadFromGist() {
  if (!this.gistId) {
    this.showToast('⚠ Gist ID not configured', 'error');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/gists/${this.gistId}`);
    const gist = await response.json();
    const data = JSON.parse(gist.files['task-tree.json'].content);

    this.tasks = data.tasks || [];
    // ... restore all state

    this.showToast('✓ Loaded from Gist', 'success');
  } catch (error) {
    this.showToast('⚠ Gist load failed', 'error');
    this.loadFromStorage();
  }
}

async saveToGist() {
  if (!this.gistId || !this.githubToken) {
    // Show modal with JSON to copy manually
    this.showManualGistUpdate();
    return;
  }

  try {
    await fetch(`https://api.github.com/gists/${this.gistId}`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `token ${this.githubToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        files: {
          'task-tree.json': {
            content: JSON.stringify(this.getFullState(), null, 2)
          }
        }
      })
    });

    this.showToast('✓ Saved to Gist', 'success');
  } catch (error) {
    this.showToast('⚠ Gist save failed', 'error');
  }
}
```

#### User Flow

**Setup (one-time):**
1. Go to https://gist.github.com/
2. Create new Gist with filename `task-tree.json`
3. Paste initial data: `{"tasks": [], "taskIdCounter": 0}`
4. Click "Create public/secret gist"
5. Copy Gist ID from URL (e.g., `abc123def456`)
6. In Settings: Enter Gist ID
7. (Optional) Create GitHub Personal Access Token for auto-save
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with `gist` scope
   - Enter token in Settings

**Daily Use:**
- **With token**: Auto-save on every change (just like localStorage)
- **Without token**: Click "Copy JSON" → Manually update Gist

**Sharing:**
- Share Gist URL: `https://gist.github.com/username/abc123def456`
- Collaborators copy Gist ID into their Settings
- Everyone reads from same Gist
- Manual coordination for writes (or use tokens)

#### Pros & Cons

✅ **Pros:**
- **Zero server maintenance**
- **Free forever** (GitHub provides hosting)
- **Built-in version history** (every Gist update is versioned)
- **Easy sharing** (just share Gist URL)
- **Privacy options** (secret Gists not indexed by search)
- **Works anywhere** (no server deployment needed)

⚠️ **Cons:**
- **Requires GitHub account**
- **Manual token setup** for auto-save (otherwise copy/paste)
- **Rate limits**: 60 requests/hour without auth, 5000/hour with token
- **No control over hosting** (dependent on GitHub)
- **Public data** (unless using secret Gist)

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Option 1: REST API | Option 2: GitHub Gist |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Development Time** | 6-8 hours | 3-4 hours |
| **Code Changes** | ~350 lines | ~150 lines |
| **Server Required** | Yes | No |
| **Monthly Cost** | $0-$5 | $0 |
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium | Low |
| **Sharing Method** | URL parameter | Gist URL |
| **Auto-Save** | Yes (always) | Yes (with token) |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Last-write-wins | Last-write-wins |
| **Version History** | Manual | Built-in |
| **Data Control** | Full | GitHub owns |
| **Privacy** | Configurable | Public/secret only |
| **Offline Fallback** | localStorage | localStorage |
| **Rate Limits** | None | 60-5000/hour |
| **Maintenance** | Server upkeep | None |
| **Extensibility** | Easy (full API) | Limited (GitHub API) |

---

### Recommendation

**For prototyping/personal use:**
→ **GitHub Gist** (faster to implement, zero maintenance)

**For team collaboration/production:**
→ **REST API Server** (more control, better UX, easier to extend)

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Start with **Gist** to validate the multi-mode storage pattern
2. Migrate to **REST API** when you need more features
3. Code is structured to support both (just swap storage backend)

---

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Storage Abstraction** (2-3 hours)
- Add `saveData()` / `loadData()` abstraction
- Add mode selection to Settings
- Replace all `saveToStorage()` calls
- Test with localStorage (no behavior change)

**Phase 2A: GitHub Gist Backend** (1-2 hours)
- Implement Gist API calls
- Add Gist ID / token to Settings
- Test load/save cycle
- Add manual JSON export fallback

**Phase 2B: REST API Backend** (4-5 hours)
- Create Node.js server
- Implement three endpoints
- Add URL parameter handling
- Deploy to hosting platform
- Test collaborative editing

**Phase 3: Polish** (1-2 hours)
- Sync status indicator
- Last synced timestamp
- Conflict detection warnings
- Error handling improvements

**Total Time:** 3-4 hours (Gist) or 6-8 hours (REST API)

---

### Technical Considerations

**Data Consistency:**
- Both options use "last-write-wins" (no merge conflicts)
- Future: Add timestamp comparison to warn about overwrites
- Future: Implement operational transforms for true collaboration

**Performance:**
- Debounce saves (2-second delay) to reduce API calls
- Client-side caching with version checking
- Optimistic updates (save locally first, sync in background)

**Security:**
- No authentication in v1 (shared access via URL knowledge)
- Future: Add API keys, user accounts, role-based access
- GitHub token stored in browser (not in Gist itself)

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Fetch API: All modern browsers (IE11 needs polyfill)
- Async/await: All modern browsers
- localStorage: Universal support

---

### Not Recommended: Real-Time Collaboration

**Why not WebSockets/CRDT?**

Real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs) requires:
- WebSocket server for live connections
- Operational Transform or CRDT for conflict resolution
- Presence indicators (who's editing what)
- Cursor position sharing
- Complex undo/redo with collaborative awareness

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High (40-60 hours)
**Value:** Low for task management use case

**Stick with "last-write-wins" + manual coordination** for now.

---

## Development History

### Session 1: Initial Implementation (Lines 1-1750)
- Core task management
- Basic graph rendering
- Parent-child relationships
- Dependency tracking
- Status cycling
- localStorage persistence
- Modal system

### Session 2: Feature Enhancements & Polish
- **Drag Behavior Swap**: Swapped Ctrl+drag and Alt+drag - Ctrl now reparents (more intuitive), Alt creates dependencies
- **Dark Mode Line Fix**: Fixed dark mode line visibility and clickability
  - Visible lines: Pure white (#ffffff), slightly thicker (2.5px)
  - Dashed/solid distinction maintained via stroke-dasharray
  - Hit lines: Invisible 15px transparent zones for easy clicking (not styled in dark mode)
  - Blue (#4299e1) reserved for hover/select states only
  - Invisible hit zones preserved in dark mode for proper click detection
- **Auto-Collapse Bug Fix**: Fixed critical auto-collapse issues
  - Root tasks no longer disappear when completed (root tasks can never be auto-hidden)
  - Only processes clicked task and its direct relationships, not all tasks on board
  - Respects manual hiding - won't auto-hide if children are manually hidden
  - Properly recurses up parent chain to collapse ancestors if needed
  - Tasks only hidden if parent is BOTH existent AND completed
- **Toast Notification System**: Created reusable toast notification system
  - Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
  - Stackable (multiple toasts appear simultaneously)
  - Three types: success (green), error (red), info (blue)
  - Slides in from right, slides out after duration
  - Click to dismiss early
  - Can be used for any feedback throughout the app
- **Copy Task Text**: Added "Copy Text" option to right-click context menu
  - Copies task title to clipboard
  - Shows green success toast notification
- **Ctrl+Drag Enhanced**: Unified interface for both reparenting and creating positioned children
  - **Visual feedback**: Always shows line from source to cursor
    - Green line when over different node (reparent mode)
    - Blue line when over empty space (create child mode)
  - **Elliptical offset positioning**: Preview positioned using ellipse math
    - Horizontal drag (0°/180°): offset = rectWidth/2 + padding
    - Vertical drag (90°/270°): offset = rectHeight/2 + padding
    - Diagonal: smooth blend using `atan2` angle calculation
    - Keeps preview edge at consistent distance from cursor
    - No jumping at any angle - perfectly smooth rotation
  - **Smart visibility**: Preview disappears when hovering over source node or any other node
  - **`elementFromPoint` detection**: Correctly detects target under cursor during drag
  - **Reparent**: Drag to different node, release to reparent
  - **Create positioned child**: Drag to empty space, release to create at cursor position
  - New child immediately enters edit mode for inline naming
- **Shift+Double Click Shortcut**: Quick keyboard shortcut to toggle children visibility
  - Shift+double click any node to hide/show its children
  - Uses same red +N badge system as context menu toggle
  - Faster workflow than right-click → Hide/Show Children
- **Arrow Direction Indicators**: Parent-child lines show pixel-perfect directional arrows
  - Solid arrow on main parent lines pointing from parent → child
  - Arrow on other parent relationships (secondary parents)
  - Dependency lines show dashed arrows
  - **Pixel-Perfect Positioning**: Arrows start exactly at rectangle edge, not center
    - Uses vector math to calculate line-to-rectangle intersection
    - Handles any angle (0°-360°) correctly
    - Cross-multiplication avoids division for edge detection
    - Arrows sit perfectly on the boundary of boxes
- **Dependency Arrow Direction Fix**: Arrow matches drag direction intuitively
  - Alt+drag from A to B: arrow shows A → B (not backwards)
  - Semantic: B depends on A (A is prerequisite of B)
  - Arrow matches visual drag motion
  - Fixed by reversing dependency order in addDependency call
  - Updated to: `addDependency({ dependentId, prerequisiteId })` named parameters
- **Defensive Parameter Order Fix**: All relationship functions use named object parameters
  - `addDependency({ dependentId, prerequisiteId })` - impossible to swap parameters
  - `createChildAtPosition({ parentId, x, y })` - clear parameter names
  - `reparentTask({ taskId, newParentId })` - explicit semantics
  - Prevents accidental parameter-order bugs that were hard to debug
  - Makes code self-documenting and less error-prone
- **Fixed Reparent Semantics**: Drag direction now matches arrow direction
  - **OLD**: Ctrl+drag A→B made A child of B (arrow B→A, backwards from drag)
  - **NEW**: Ctrl+drag A→B makes B child of A (arrow A→B, matches drag!)
  - Intuitive: dragging creates children in the direction you drag
  - Preview arrow always shows source→target (matches final result)
- **Consistent Arrow Direction During Drag**: All drag operations show intuitive arrows
  - **Reparent (Ctrl+drag to node)**: Shows source → target (drag direction)
  - **Create Child (Ctrl+drag to empty)**: Shows source → position (drag direction)
  - **Dependency (Alt+drag)**: Shows prerequisite → dependent (drag direction)
  - All three operations: drag direction = arrow direction

### Session 2 (Earlier): Feature Enhancements
- **Zoom System**: Multi-input zoom (buttons, keyboard, mouse wheel, fit)
- **Coordinate Fix**: Proper SVG transformation for accurate clicks at any zoom
- **Hide Subtree**: Auto-collapse completed tasks with +N badge indicator
- **Status Bar**: Always-visible bar with default message, working task info
- **Click Redesign**: Right-click menu, Ctrl+Click child, Alt+Click delete
- **Node Selection**: Left-click selects, Backspace deletes, blue highlight
- **Line Selection**: Click-to-select lines, Backspace to delete relationships
- **Double-Click Fix**: requestAnimationFrame deferral to preserve event sequences
- **Line Interaction**: Wide hit zones (15px), blue hover, forgiving clicking
- **Visual Polish**: Modern gradients, emoji indicators (✅🔄), shadows, animations
- **Dark Mode**: Black canvas, adjusted colors, persistent preference
- **Control Panel**: Dark navy gradient, improved button styling

### Session 3: Custom Cursor & Simplified Text Truncation
- **Custom Rotating Cursor Arrow**: Interactive cursor during drag operations
  - Appears during Ctrl+drag (reparent/create child) and Alt+drag (dependencies)
  - SVG arrow icon that rotates based on drag angle using `Math.atan2(dy, dx)`
  - Fixed position SVG element following cursor at all times
  - Hides default cursor with CSS `cursor: none` on all canvas elements
  - 24×24px arrow with drop shadow for visibility
  - Cleans up automatically when drag ends
  - Works at any zoom level
- **Simplified Text Truncation**: Clean, intuitive text expansion
  - **Automatic truncation** at customizable character threshold (default: 60)
  - **Customizable via UI**: Number input in toolbar (10-100 chars)
  - **Click to expand**: Single click on truncated node expands to full text
  - **Lock button (🔓/🔒)**: Appears on expanded nodes
    - 🔓 unlocked = will collapse when stopping work
    - 🔒 locked = permanently expanded
    - Disabled (greyed out) when task is "working"
  - **Smart unlock behavior**:
    - If node selected → stays expanded when unlocking
    - If node NOT selected → immediately collapses when unlocking
  - **Auto-expand on working**: Tasks being worked on auto-expand
    - Collapse when stopping work if unlocked
    - Stay expanded if locked
  - **Persistent state**: Both `textExpanded` and `textLocked` saved per task
  - **Dynamic sizing**: Node width adjusts based on displayed text
  - **Smooth animations**: CSS transitions for width changes
  - **Lock button positioning**: Positioned outside box to the left with background circle
  - **Arrow positioning fix**: Arrows now snap to correct rect edge when text expands/collapses
    - Calculates display title in link rendering (not just node rendering)
    - Arrows always point to current node size, not full title size
  - **Enhanced truncation indicator**: Initially changed from "..." to "...►" (blue, 120% size)
    - Later simplified to plain "..." in normal text color for cleaner appearance
    - Removed complex SVG tspan styling in favor of simple text concatenation
  - **Smart truncation logic**: Only truncate if worth it
    - Don't truncate if only 5 or fewer chars beyond threshold (e.g., 60→65)
    - Prevents awkward truncation for minimal text savings
  - **Hover reveal (REMOVED)**: Initially implemented hover-to-reveal feature
    - Attempted to show full text on hover by calling render()
    - **Critical bug**: Calling render() on hover destroyed all DOM elements mid-interaction
    - Broke drag functionality, click detection, and created "invisible blocking layer" effect
    - **Removed**: Hover handlers that triggered re-render (incompatible with render architecture)
    - **Lesson**: Don't call render() during active mouse interactions
  - **Optimized padding**: Node padding reduced from 20px → 17px → 10px → 5px → 0px → 5px (final)
    - Updated in 4 locations: node rendering + 3 arrow calculation sections
    - Preview node kept at 10px (independent)
  - **Centralized configuration**: Refactored hardcoded sizing values to app state
    - Added `charWidth: 8`, `nodePadding: 5`, `minNodeWidth: 80` to app state (lines 761-764)
    - Updated all 4 locations to reference `this.charWidth`, `this.nodePadding`, `this.minNodeWidth`
    - Enables easy future customization via UI controls or JSON config
    - Single source of truth for sizing parameters
    - **Pattern**: Any user-customizable parameter should be added to app state, not hardcoded
    - **Benefit**: Changed charWidth 7→8 with single line edit (not 4 edits)
  - **Font customization**: Added fontFamily configuration
    - `fontFamily: "'Fira Code', 'Consolas', 'Monaco', 'Courier New', monospace"` in app state (line 764)
    - Applied to SVG text elements (line 2701) and edit input (line 2683)
    - Also set in CSS as fallback (line 163)
    - Beautiful monospace font for improved readability
    - Demonstrates configuration pattern in action
  - **Settings UI Modal**: Dynamic configuration interface
    - **⚙️ Settings Button**: Added to toolbar for easy access to all customization options
    - **Dynamic Form Generation**: Form built automatically from configuration metadata
    - **Available Settings**:
      - Text Truncation Length (20-200 chars)
      - Character Width (4-15px) - affects node sizing
      - Node Padding (0-20px) - internal spacing
      - Minimum Node Width (40-200px)
      - Font Family - CSS font stack with fallbacks
      - Font Weight - Light (300) to Bold (700)
      - Show Delete Confirmation - Toggle confirmation dialog when deleting
    - **Features**:
      - Live apply: Changes take effect immediately when clicking "Apply"
      - Auto-save: Settings persist to localStorage automatically
      - Reset to Defaults: Restore original values with confirmation dialog
      - Export/import: Settings included in JSON export for sharing configurations

      - `showSettingsModal()` - Generates form from `configDefs` metadata object
      - `applySettings()` - Reads form values, updates app state, re-renders, saves
      - `resetSettings()` - Restores defaults with confirmation
      - `hideSettingsModal()` - Closes modal
    - **Configuration Metadata Pattern**: Each setting defined with:
      - `label`: Display name (e.g., "Character Width (px)")
      - `type`: Input type (number, text, select)
      - `default`: Default value for reset functionality
      - `min`/`max`/`step`: Constraints for number inputs
      - `options`: Array of {value, label} for select inputs
      - `description`: Help text explaining the setting
    - **User Experience**: Toast notification confirms successful apply/reset
    - **Benefit**: Non-technical users can customize appearance without editing code

### Session 4: Settings Enhancement & Physics Removal
- **Physics Feature Removal**: Completely removed physics simulation
  - Removed `togglePhysics()` function and physics button from toolbar
  - Removed `startPhysicsSimulation()` and all force calculation code
  - Removed `physicsEnabled` from app state and localStorage
  - Cleaned up all references from clearAllData and loadFromStorage
  - Removed `vx`/`vy` velocity properties (no longer needed)
  - **Rationale**: Feature was rarely used and added complexity
- **Settings Modal Improvements**:
  - **ESC Key Support**: Press Escape to close settings without saving
  - **Click-Outside to Close**: Click modal backdrop to cancel
  - Both properly clean up event listeners to prevent memory leaks
- **Export Settings Feature**:
  - New "Export Settings" button in Settings modal
  - Copies current configuration as clean JSON to clipboard
  - Enables easy sharing of customized defaults
  - Toast notification confirms successful copy
  - Format allows pasting settings directly to developer
- **Modal Button Visibility Fix**:
  - Fixed white text on white background bug in modals
  - Added proper color contrast for light mode modal buttons
  - Added complete dark mode styling for all modals
  - Styled node context menus for dark mode
  - All buttons now clearly visible in both light and dark modes

### Session 5: UI Simplification & Undo/Redo System

#### Phase 1-3: UI Simplification (Completed in previous session)
- **Toolbar Cleanup**: Removed "Add Root Task" button and input field for cleaner interface
- **Ctrl+Click Creation**: Click empty canvas space with Ctrl to create root tasks
- **Right-Click Menu**: Added "Create Task Here" option to empty space right-click menu
- **Mark Origin**:
  - "Mark Origin" button stores current task center and zoom level as reference point
  - Creates/updates "Origin Home" bookmark for easy return to starting view
  - Fixed panning logic - app moves tasks directly, not viewBox coordinates

#### Phase 4: Comprehensive Undo/Redo System
- **Full Snapshot-Based Undo**: Every operation creates a snapshot of the entire task array
  - Deep cloning using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` ensures reliable state restoration
  - 50-step history limit with automatic trimming of oldest entries
  - Both undo and redo stacks persist to localStorage across sessions
- **Smart Edit Grouping**: Sequential edits to the same task within 2 seconds merge into single undo step
  - Prevents character-by-character undo during typing
  - Uses task ID matching and timestamp comparison
  - Replaces last snapshot instead of creating new one when grouping applies
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac): Undo
  - Ctrl+Shift+Z (Cmd+Shift+Z on Mac): Redo
  - Ctrl+Y (Windows alternative): Redo
- **Toast Notifications**: Every undo/redo shows descriptive toast with action description
  - Action descriptions truncated at 50 characters for readability
  - Success toast (green) shows "✓ Undone: [action]" or "✓ Redone: [action]"
  - Error toast (red) shows "Nothing to undo/redo" when stacks are empty
- **Comprehensive Operation Coverage** (20 saveSnapshot() integration points):
  - Task creation: root tasks, child tasks, Ctrl+Click, right-click menu
  - Task editing: finishEditing() with smart 2-second grouping by task ID
  - Task deletion: deleteTask() with truncated task title in description
  - Status cycling: cycleStatus() tracks pending/working/done transitions
  - Status toggle: toggleDone() for context menu mark done/pending (includes flow-state logic)
  - Visibility: toggleHidden() for show/hide children
  - Drag operations: Move task, move subtree (with 5px movement threshold)
  - Dependencies: addDependency() and removeDependency() with both task names
  - Data operations: importData() with task count, clearAllData()
  - Reparenting: createChildAtPosition() and reparentTask()
  - **NOT Undoable**: Canvas panning - viewport navigation doesn't clear redo stack
- **Storage Quota Handling**:
  - Try-catch wraps localStorage save operations
  - On QuotaExceededError: Automatically trims undo history to last 10 steps
  - Retries save after trimming, shows error toast if still fails
  - Prevents undo history from breaking app when storage fills up
- **Circular Prevention**: `isUndoing` flag prevents recursive snapshots
  - Set to true during undo()/redo() operations
  - saveSnapshot() returns early when flag is true
  - Prevents infinite loops and corrupted undo stacks
- **Updated Confirmation Dialog**: "Clear All Data" now says "can be undone with Ctrl+Z"
- **Help Text Update**: Added "Ctrl+Z: undo | Ctrl+Shift+Z: redo" to toolbar info span
- **Critical UX Fix**: Canvas panning does NOT create undo snapshots
  - Viewport navigation (panning) is distinct from content modification
  - Prevents panning from clearing the redo stack
  - Users can now undo, pan to look around, then redo without losing redo history
  - Moving individual tasks/subtrees still creates undo snapshots (content changes)
- **Flow State Enhancement**: Auto-start parent when completing working task
  - When marking a "currently working" task as done, automatically starts working on parent
  - Maintains productivity momentum: finish subtask → continue on parent goal
  - Only applies if parent exists and isn't already done
  - Shows informative toast notification with parent name
  - Implemented in both cycleStatus() (middle-click) and toggleDone() (context menu)
- **Golden Path Visualization**: Visual hierarchy arrows for working task
  - **Ancestor path**: Golden/amber (#f59e0b) glowing arrows from working task ALL the way to root
  - **Direct children**: Red (#f44336) for incomplete, Green (#4caf50) for done children
  - Shows complete context tree + progress at a glance
  - Implementation: `getWorkingTaskPath()` helper builds full path including working task itself
  - Rendering checks if both task AND parent are in ancestorPath set (fixed bug where only first parent was highlighted)
  - Children colored by completion status to highlight blockers (red) vs. completed work (green)
  - Custom SVG arrowhead marker for golden ancestor path
- **Implementation Details**:
  - State properties: undoStack, redoStack, maxUndoSteps (50), isUndoing, lastSnapshotTime, lastSnapshotTaskId
  - Functions: saveSnapshot(description, taskId), undo(), redo()
  - localStorage persistence: undoStack and redoStack arrays saved with full state
  - Each snapshot: { tasks: [...], description: string, timestamp: number }
- **How It Works Internally**:
  - **saveSnapshot()**: Deep clones current tasks array → pushes to undoStack → clears redoStack
  - **undo()**: Saves current to redoStack → pops from undoStack → restores tasks
  - **redo()**: Saves current to undoStack → pops from redoStack → restores tasks
  - **Deep cloning**: `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` prevents reference corruption
  - **isUndoing flag**: Prevents infinite loops (saveToStorage during undo would trigger saveSnapshot)
  - See CLAUDE.md "How Undo/Redo Works" section for complete algorithm explanation

#### Phase 5: Configuration Persistence & Optional Delete Confirmation
- **Full Configuration Persistence**: All user settings now saved to localStorage
  - **What persists**: textLengthThreshold, charWidth, nodePadding, minNodeWidth, fontFamily, fontWeight, showDeleteConfirmation
  - **Why**: Previously only task data persisted; now complete UI customization survives reloads
  - **Implementation**: Expanded saveToStorage() and loadFromStorage() to include all config properties
  - **Default handling**: Uses null-coalescing operator (??) to properly distinguish false from undefined
  - **Export/Import**: Settings included in JSON export/import for sharing configurations
- **Optional Delete Confirmation**:
  - **New setting**: "Show Delete Confirmation" checkbox in Settings modal (default: enabled)
  - **Behavior**: When enabled, shows confirmation dialog before deleting tasks
  - **When disabled**: Tasks delete immediately without confirmation (still undoable with Ctrl+Z)
  - **Implementation**: Modified deleteTask() with conditional confirmation based on app.showDeleteConfirmation
  - **UI Integration**: Added checkbox input type support to Settings modal
- **Settings Modal Enhancement**:
  - **Checkbox support**: Added type='checkbox' to configDefs metadata system
  - **Form generation**: Checkbox inputs render with proper label and checked state
  - **Value reading**: applySettings() now handles .checked property for checkbox inputs
  - **Reset support**: resetSettings() works with boolean checkbox defaults
- **Metadata-Driven Pattern**:
  - Configuration defined once in configDefs object with type, label, default, description
  - Settings modal automatically generates appropriate input (number, text, select, checkbox)
  - Single source of truth eliminates duplicate code for new settings

### Session 6: Homes - Named Bookmark System

**Homes Feature**: Named bookmarks for quick navigation to different areas of large graphs

**Core Implementation**:
- **Data Model**:
  - Replaced old origin system (originMarked, originX, originY, originZoomLevel) with flexible homes array
  - Each home: `{ id, name, centerX, centerY, zoomLevel, timestamp }`
  - homeIdCounter for unique IDs
  - Unique name validation (case-insensitive)
- **Migration Logic**:
  - Auto-migrates old origin data to "Origin Home" on first load
  - Backward compatible with existing saved data
  - Shows one-time info toast on migration
- **Core Functions**:
  - `createHome(name)`: Save current view with validation (unique names, >20 warning)
  - `jumpToHome(homeId, animate)`: Navigate with smooth CSS animation (0.5s cubic-bezier)
  - `updateHome(homeId)`: Update existing home to current view
  - `deleteHome(homeId)`: Remove with optional confirmation
  - `renameHome(homeId, newName)`: Change name with validation
- **Updated Mark Origin**:
  - "Mark Origin" now creates/updates "Origin Home" (using createHome/updateHome)
  - Jump to "Origin Home" using keybinds or Homes dropdown

**UI Components**:
- **Toolbar Dropdown**:
  - "🏠 Homes" button with dynamic dropdown menu
  - Lists all homes sorted alphabetically ("Origin Home" first)
  - "+ Create New Home" and "⚙️ Manage Homes" actions
  - Click-outside-to-close behavior
- **Right-Click Submenu**:
  - "🏠 Homes" nested submenu in empty-space context menu
  - Same functionality as toolbar dropdown
  - Hover-triggered with → arrow indicator
  - Positioned to right of parent menu
- **Create Home Modal**:
  - Text input with 50-char limit
  - Enter key submits
  - Unique name validation with error toasts
  - Auto-focus on open
- **Manage Homes Modal**:
  - Scrollable list of home cards (max-height: 400px)
  - Each card shows: name, zoom level, position coordinates
  - Four actions per home: Jump, Update, Rename, Delete
  - Purple highlighting for "Origin Home"
  - Empty state message when no homes exist

**Visual Design**:
- **CSS Styling**:
  - Dropdown: Dark semi-transparent (#1a1a2e, 98% opacity), 8px border-radius
  - Purple special highlighting for "Origin Home" (rgba(156, 39, 176, 0.2))
  - Smooth hover transitions (0.2s)
  - Nested submenu with right-positioned dropdown
- **Animation**:
  - `.animating-view` class applies 0.5s cubic-bezier transition to all SVG children
  - Smooth pan and zoom simultaneously
  - Auto-removes class after 500ms
- **Sorting**:
  - "Origin Home" always first
  - Remaining homes alphabetically sorted
  - Consistent across dropdown, submenu, and manage modal

**Technical Details**:
- **localStorage Integration**:
  - homes and homeIdCounter saved alongside tasks
  - Removed old origin properties from save/load
  - Updated both normal and quota-exceeded save paths
- **Event Handlers**:
  - Modal click-outside-to-close listeners
  - Enter key in input field triggers create
  - Dropdown click-outside with setTimeout deferral
- **Use of prompt()**:
  - Rename function uses native prompt() (no longer in sandboxed mode)
  - Simple inline rename without custom input modal
- **Architecture**:
  - ~350 lines of new code added
  - Follows existing modal/dropdown patterns
  - Reuses toast notification system
  - Integrates with showConfirmDialog for delete confirmation

**User Experience**:
- **No Homes**: Empty states in dropdown ("No homes created yet") and modal
- **1-20 Homes**: Normal operation, sorted list
- **>20 Homes**: Warning toast on creation ("⚠️ Home created (X homes - consider organizing)")
- **Smooth Navigation**: Animated transitions feel polished and professional
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Purple for special, sorted predictably, clean spacing
- **Error Handling**: Duplicate name validation, empty name prevention, clear error messages

**Line Count**: ~4500 lines total in task-tree.html after this session

### Session 6 Continued: Animation Polish & Dark Mode Fixes

**Animation Refactor**: Transform-based rendering for smooth Home navigation
- **Problem**: Initial animation implementation didn't work - nodes just snapped to new positions
- **Root Cause**: `render()` was destroying and recreating all DOM elements during animation
  - CSS transitions only work when the SAME DOM element changes properties
  - Creating new elements = instant position change, no animation
- **Solution**: Major architectural refactor to transform-based positioning
  - Changed from absolute positioning (`<rect x="500" y="300">`) to group transforms (`<g transform="translate(500, 300)"><rect x="0" y="0">`)
  - Updated entire rendering pipeline (nodes, text, lock buttons, badges, preview nodes)
  - Nodes now persist and only their transform attribute updates during animation

**Line Animation Attempts**:
- **Challenge**: Lines need to animate smoothly with nodes
- **Attempt 1**: CSS transitions on x1/y1/x2/y2 attributes → doesn't work (XML attributes, not CSS properties)
- **Attempt 2**: Manual position updates with data attributes → sync issues (lines ahead of nodes)
- **Attempt 3**: Offset-based calculations → still had visual artifacts
- **Final Solution**: Professional fade-out/fade-in approach
  - Lines fade to opacity 0 during animation (0.15s)
  - Nodes slide smoothly via transform (0.5s)
  - After animation completes, re-render lines with perfect positioning
  - Clean, professional result without fighting browser limitations

**Technical Details**:
- **CSS Animation Rules** (lines 666-681):
  - `.animating-view .task-node { transition: transform 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) }`
  - `.animating-view line { opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.15s ease-out }`
- **Transform-Based Rendering** (lines 3397-3634):
  - All nodes wrapped in `<g>` elements with `transform="translate(x, y)"`
  - Child elements positioned relative to group center
  - Lock buttons, badges, text all use relative coordinates
- **Animation Logic in jumpToHome()** (lines 4206-4245):
  - Add `.animating-view` class
  - Update data model positions
  - Update node transforms via DOM (triggers CSS transition)
  - After 500ms: remove class, re-render lines

**Submenu UX Fix**:
- **Problem**: Homes submenu in right-click menu disappeared when mousing over to it
- **Cause**: Gap between parent menu item and submenu, plus submenu only showed on parent hover
- **Solution** (lines 133-179):
  - Overlap submenu slightly with parent (`margin-left: -2px`)
  - Add invisible padding as "hover bridge" (`padding-left: 6px`)
  - Show submenu on both parent hover AND submenu hover (`.submenu:hover`)
  - Compensate padding in submenu items for proper alignment
  - Much more forgiving user experience

**Dark Mode Consistency** (lines 857-908):
- Added complete dark mode styling for Homes dropdown and submenu
- Consistent color scheme: `rgba(30, 41, 59, 0.98)` background, light grey text
- Matches existing dark mode patterns for modals and context menus
- Purple highlighting for "Origin Home" works in both modes

**Light Mode Fix** (lines 72-219):
- Fixed dropdown and submenu backgrounds to use light theme by default
- Changed from dark `rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.98)` to light `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.98)`
- Updated text colors from white to dark grey (`#333`)
- Proper contrast and hover states in both light and dark modes
- Now properly adapts to current theme

**Cinematic 3-Phase Animation** (lines 4289-4363, 1897-1908):
- **Evolution**: First implemented simultaneous pan+zoom, then refined to cinematic phased approach
- **Phase 1 (0-300ms)**: Zoom out to 50% of minimum zoom for overview context
- **Phase 2 (300-800ms)**: Pan to new location while staying zoomed out (CSS transform transition)
- **Phase 3 (800-1300ms)**: Zoom in to target zoom level with ease-out curve
- Created `updateViewBoxOnly()` helper function to update viewBox without full re-render
- Uses `panTriggered` flag to ensure pan only fires once at phase transition
- Total 1.3 second animation feels professional and provides spatial awareness

**Key Architectural Lesson**:
- Transform-based positioning is the standard SVG pattern for a reason
- Enables GPU acceleration for smooth 60fps animations
- CSS can transition `transform` but NOT most SVG attributes
- When browser limitations exist (like line attributes), professional workarounds (fade-out/fade-in) are better than fighting them
- For complex animations, combine CSS transitions (for transforms) with requestAnimationFrame (for viewBox/zoom)

**Line Count**: ~4620 lines total in task-tree.html after animation refactor and fixes

### Session 7: Multi-Select System

**Core Feature**: Shift+Click to select multiple tasks, Shift+Drag to box select

**Implementation Overview**:
- **State Change**: Replaced `selectedTaskId` (single) with `selectedTaskIds` (Set)
- **Selection Modes**:
  - Click: Select single (clears others)
  - Shift+Click: Toggle in/out of selection
  - Shift+Drag on empty: Box select (additive)
  - Escape: Clear all selection
- **Operations on Multi-Select**:
  - Drag to move all selected together (maintains relative positions)
  - Delete multiple with confirmation dialog
  - Right-click shows multi-select aware menu ("Delete (3)", "Mark Done (3)", etc.)
- **Relationship Operations**:
  - Alt+Drag to selected task creates dependencies from source to all selected
  - Ctrl+Drag multiple selected to parent makes all children of that parent
  - Reparenting happens when dragging one of the selected nodes

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Selection State** (lines 1111-1116):
  - `selectedTaskIds: new Set()` - Multiple IDs instead of single
  - `lastClickedTaskId` - For future range selection support
  - `boxSelectStart`, `isBoxSelecting` - For box drag detection

- **Selection Logic** (lines 1223-1241):
  - Shift+Click toggles in Set: `has()` check, then `add()`/`delete()`
  - Normal click: `clear()` then `add()` for single selection

- **Box Selection** (lines 2652-2658, 2676-2701, 2945-2966):
  - MouseDown: If Shift+Click on empty, set `dragMode = 'box-select'`
  - MouseMove: Draw semi-transparent blue rectangle preview
  - MouseUp: Find nodes in box bounds, add to selection (additive)

- **Multi-Node Operations**:
  - Movement (lines 2709-2730): Check if dragged node is selected, move all if yes
  - Delete (lines 1754-1794): New `deleteMultipleTasks()` function
  - Right-click menu (lines 3189-3192): Toggle selection, show multi-aware options

- **Relationship Ops**:
  - Dependencies (lines 2923-2930): Check if target is in selection, create to all
  - Reparenting (lines 2906-2912): Check if source is selected with multiple, reparent all

**Polish Features**:
- Escape key to clear selection (lines 1320-1326)
- Undo snapshot naming: "Moved 3 tasks" instead of single task name
- Multi-select context menu shows count: "Delete (3 selected)"
- Maintains selection across operations (don't auto-clear after action)

**Line Count**: ~4720 lines total in task-tree.html after multi-select implementation

### Session 7 Continued: Multi-Project Support & Bug Fixes

**Multi-Project Feature**: One working task per root graph instead of globally

**Implementation**:
- **New Function** `getRootTask()` (lines 1817-1828):
  - Traverse up the parent chain to find root task
  - Returns null if task not found
  - Used to identify which project a task belongs to

- **Updated toggleWorking()** (lines 1574-1607):
  - Find root task of current task
  - Only clear working status for tasks in SAME root graph
  - Tasks in different projects keep their working state
  - Each project can have one task actively being worked on

- **Updated render()** (lines 3575-3602):
  - Find ALL working tasks (not just one)
  - Build ancestor/children lists for each working task
  - Apply visual indicators to all working paths simultaneously
  - Golden path shows all active working contexts

**Benefits**:
- Multi-project workflows: manage A and B simultaneously
- Team dashboards: see multiple initiatives at once
- Better context switching: pause project A, resume project B without losing state

**Bug Fixes**:
1. **Canvas drag no longer deselects** (lines 2673, 3041-3054):
   - Track `dragStartOriginal` position
   - Calculate pan distance in mouseUp
   - Only clear selection if distance < 5px (actual click)
   - Pan movements preserve selection ✓

2. **Box selection visual glitch fixed** (line 3027):
   - Added missing `this.render()` after completing box selection
   - Nodes now highlight immediately ✓

3. **Reparenting with selected targets** (lines 2915-2928):
   - Check if TARGET is selected (not just source)
   - Ctrl+Drag unselected→selected makes all selected children of source ✓

4. **Dependencies with selected sources** (lines 2944-2960):
   - Check if SOURCE is selected (multi-source mode)
   - Also check if TARGET is selected (multi-target mode)
   - Alt+Drag unselected→selected creates arrows from source to all selected ✓

**Line Count**: ~4800 lines total in task-tree.html after multi-project implementation

### Session 7 Final: Working Task Log Optimization

**Problem**: The previous multi-project implementation used `getRootTask()` traversal for every render operation to find which task was working in each project. This was inefficient (O(n) per task in worst case).

**Solution**: Implemented working task log pattern - a simple dictionary maintaining one working task ID per root, enabling O(1) lookup.

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
workingTasksByRoot: {
    [rootTaskId]: workingTaskId,  // e.g., { 1: 5, 3: 7 } = "working on task 5 in project 1, task 7 in project 3"
    // ...
}
```

**Implementation Details**:

1. **New State Variable** (line 1147):
   - Added `workingTasksByRoot: {}` to app object
   - Single source of truth for working tasks across all projects

2. **Updated toggleWorking()** (lines 1576-1612):
   - Get root task ONCE when toggling
   - Only update the log for that specific root
   - O(1) performance compared to previous traversal

3. **Added Cleanup Logic**:
   - **deleteTask()** (lines 1760-1765): Remove entry from log if deleted task was working
   - **reparentTask()** (lines 3113-3140): When task changes roots, update log entries
     - Save old root entry for working task
     - Update new root entry after reparenting

4. **Updated Persistence**:
   - **saveToStorage()** (lines 4405-4430): Persist `workingTasksByRoot` dictionary
   - **loadFromStorage()** (lines 4472): Restore `workingTasksByRoot` with empty object default

5. **Optimized render()** (lines 3605-3635):
   - Changed from: `this.tasks.filter(t => t.currentlyWorking)` (O(n) filter)
   - Changed to: `Object.values(this.workingTasksByRoot).forEach(...)` (O(# of roots))
   - Much faster for large task graphs with few projects

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: O(1) lookup instead of O(n) traversal
- **Correctness**: Single source of truth prevents synchronization bugs
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead - just object with number of roots entries
- **Clarity**: Explicit data structure makes intent clear

**Testing**:
- Multiple projects can each have independent working tasks
- Working states survive page reload (persisted to localStorage)
- Deleting working task cleans up log entry
- Reparenting working task updates log correctly
- No stale log entries after operations

### Key Learnings & Patterns

**SVG Event Handling**:
- `closest()` doesn't work reliably in SVG - use direct element checks
- Two-layer line approach (invisible hit + visible display) for easy clicking
- `pointer-events: stroke` for wide hit detection on transparent lines

**Rendering Challenges**:
- Frequent re-renders destroy event listeners
- Solution: Attach listeners during render OR defer renders with requestAnimationFrame
- Mouse coordinate transformation critical: use `getScreenCTM().inverse()`
- **CRITICAL**: Never call `render()` during active mouse interactions (hover, drag, click)
  - Destroys DOM elements mid-interaction, breaking drag/click detection
  - Creates "invisible blocking layer" as elements constantly recreate
  - Use CSS-only hover effects or defer render to after interaction completes

**Click Detection**:
- `mousedown` with `preventDefault()` blocks subsequent `click` events
- Early return from mousedown for specific elements (like lines) allows clicks through
- Check `e.target.tagName` directly for SVG elements

**State Management**:
- All state in single `app` object
- localStorage for persistence
- Save on every change for data safety
- Load preferences on init (dark mode, zoom, settings)
- **Configuration Pattern**: Any user-customizable parameter should be added to app state
  - Examples: `charWidth`, `nodePadding`, `minNodeWidth`, `textLengthThreshold`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`
  - Enables Settings UI and JSON import/export for user customization
  - Keep hardcoded values only for truly fixed constants

**Undo/Redo UX Pattern**:
- Distinguish between **content modifications** (undoable) and **viewport navigation** (not undoable)
- Content: create/delete/edit tasks, change status, add dependencies → creates undo snapshot
- Viewport: pan canvas, zoom → does NOT create undo snapshot
- Critical: Viewport actions must NOT clear the redo stack
- Users expect to undo, pan to look around, then redo without losing history
- Moving individual tasks/subtrees IS content modification (changes data relationships)

**Undo/Redo Integration (for developers)**:
- ⚠️ **Not automated** - requires manual `saveSnapshot()` call for each operation
- Integration checklist maintained in `task-tree.html` (line 3426) with all 18 integration points
- When adding new operations: Check CLAUDE.md "Adding Undo/Redo to New Operations" section
- Silent failure mode: Forgetting `saveSnapshot()` means operation won't be undoable (no warnings)
- Test every new operation: Do action → Ctrl+Z → Ctrl+Shift+Z to verify undo/redo works
- Future improvement opportunity: Auto-detection via Proxy wrapper on `this.tasks`

## How to Remind Claude to Update README

### Option 1: CLAUDE.md Integration
Add this to the top of `/mnt/c/Users/gmmer/Documents/projects/graphdo/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE

**ALWAYS follow this sequence when working on this project:**

1. **READ** `README.md` FIRST - Get full context of current state
2. **DO** the requested work - Implement features/fixes
3. **UPDATE** `README.md` LAST - Document all changes made

If you skip step 3, you will lose project continuity on the next session.
```

### Option 2: User Prompts
After each work session, ask:
> "Did you update the README with the changes we made?"

### Option 3: Git Commit Hook (Future)
If you add git to this project, create a pre-commit hook that checks if README.md was modified when other files changed.

### Session 8: Bug Fixes and Hide Node Feature

**New Feature: Hide Node Within Parent**
- **Shift+Double-Click**: Now hides the node itself within its parent (instead of hiding children)
- Only works for child tasks (root tasks cannot be hidden)
- Hidden nodes preserve their state and can be revealed by clicking parent's hidden children badge
- Implementation:
  - Added `toggleHiddenSelf()` function (line 1739)
  - Updated both shift+double-click handlers (lines 1174 and 4012)
  - Still supports hiding children via right-click context menu and hidden badge

**Multi-Project Bug Fixes**:
1. **Fixed cycleStatus() clearing other projects' working tasks** (lines 1507-1567):
   - Was calling `this.tasks.forEach(t => t.currentlyWorking = false)` which cleared ALL projects
   - Now respects per-project boundaries using working log
   - Only clears working in same root tree
   - Properly maintains `workingTasksByRoot` log

2. **Fixed toggleDone() clearing other projects' working tasks** (lines 1575-1618):
   - Added proper root task detection
   - Updates working log correctly on mark done
   - Respects per-project boundaries

3. **Fixed Golden Path Visualization for Multi-Project** (lines 3682-3714):
   - Was only finding ONE working task with `this.tasks.find(t => t.currentlyWorking)`
   - Now collects paths from ALL working tasks in log
   - Combines ancestor paths into unified Set
   - Correctly checks if parent is ANY working task (not just one)
   - Golden paths now show for all active projects simultaneously

**Testing**:
- Multiple projects each have independent working states ✓
- Shift+double-click hides child nodes ✓
- Other projects unaffected when changing working state ✓
- Golden paths glow for all working tasks ✓
- Flow state (auto-parent) works per-project ✓

### Session 8 Continued: Auto-Hide Settings Feature

**New Configurable Feature: Auto-Hide Completed Nodes**
- **Problem**: Some users may not want automatic hiding of completed nodes - different workflows have different preferences
- **Solution**: Added toggle setting in ⚙️ Settings to enable/disable auto-hide behavior
- **Default**: Enabled (maintains current behavior for existing users)

**Implementation**:
1. **New Configuration Option** (line 1146):
   - Added `autoHideCompletedNodes: true` to app state
   - Defaults to true to maintain existing behavior

2. **Updated autoCollapseCompleted()** (lines 1936-1940):
   - Added early return if `this.autoHideCompletedNodes` is false
   - Setting respected on every mark-done operation
   - Doesn't affect manual hiding via right-click menu or shift+double-click

3. **Settings UI Integration** (lines 2288-2293):
   - Added to configDefs with checkbox type
   - Label: "Auto-Hide Completed Nodes"
   - Description: "Automatically hide child nodes when they and their parent are marked done"
   - Appears in ⚙️ Settings modal alongside other configuration options

4. **Persistence** (lines 4538, 4565, 4618):
   - Saved to localStorage in both primary and fallback save paths
   - Loaded with proper default (true) if missing from saved data

5. **Documentation** (README updated):
   - Updated Visibility Management section to mention setting
   - Added to Settings UI available options list

**Testing**:
- Toggle setting ON: Completed nodes auto-hide as before ✓
- Toggle setting OFF: Completed nodes stay visible when done ✓
- Setting persists across page reloads ✓
- Manual hiding still works when setting is OFF ✓
- Works correctly with multi-project setup ✓

### Session 8 Final: Hide Child Context Menu Options

**New Feature: Hide Child Menu Options**
- Added "Hide Child" to multi-select context menu (formatted like other batch operations)
  - Shows count: "Hide Child (3)" when multiple tasks selected
  - Hides all selected child tasks (toggles visibility of each)
  - Root tasks are skipped (cannot be hidden - requires parent)

- Added "Show/Hide" to single-select context menu (appears conditionally)
  - Only shows when task has a parent (is not a root task)
  - Label toggles: "Hide" when visible, "Show" when hidden
  - Positioned before "Show/Hide Children" in menu order
  - Distinguishes from "Show/Hide Children" which affects children, not the node itself

**Implementation** (lines 3441-3464):
1. Multi-select: Added `Hide Child (${count})` button after Mark Pending (line 3441-3447)
2. Single-select: Added conditional "Show/Hide" button for non-root tasks (line 3461-3464)
3. Both use existing `toggleHiddenSelf()` function
4. Smart button labels based on hidden state

**Menu Structure** (for clarity):
- **Multi-Select Options**: Mark Done → Mark Pending → Hide Child → Delete
- **Single-Select Options**: Add Child → Mark Done/Pending → Start/Stop Working → Show/Hide (if parent) → Show/Hide Children (if children) → Copy Text → Delete

**Documentation Updated**:
- Multi-select menu updated to show all options
- Single-task context menu section now clarifies two hide options
- Shows "Show/Hide" for node vs "Show/Hide Children" for children

**Testing**:
- Multi-select: "Hide Child (3)" hides all 3 selected tasks ✓
- Single-select: "Hide"/"Show" option only appears for child tasks ✓
- Root tasks don't show hide option ✓
- Menu order is consistent and logical ✓

### Session 9: Text Editing Experience Improvements

**Problem**: Inline text editor had two UX issues:
1. Editing box didn't cover the full width of the rectangle (gaps on sides)
2. Text displayed starting at end/center instead of beginning (awkward for editing)

**Solution**: Improved the SVG foreignObject and input styling

**Implementation** (lines 3987-3996):
1. **Expanded foreignObject to full rectangle width**:
   - Changed x from `-rectWidth / 2 + 5` → `-rectWidth / 2` (remove left inset)
   - Changed width from `rectWidth - 10` → `rectWidth` (full rectangle width)
   - ForeignObject now matches rectangle exactly with no gaps

2. **Changed Text Alignment to Left**:
   - Changed `text-align: center` → `text-align: left`
   - Text cursor and content now starts at left edge
   - Matches typical input field behavior

3. **Improved Padding and Box Sizing**:
   - Changed `padding: 4px` → `padding: 4px 8px` (more breathing room left/right)
   - Added `box-sizing: border-box` to prevent border from expanding width
   - Input internal padding now properly respects rectangle boundaries

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Input box visually fills the entire rectangle
- ✅ Text starts at left edge, intuitive for editing long titles
- ✅ More professional appearance
- ✅ Consistent with standard HTML input behavior
- ✅ Better spacing with 8px horizontal padding

**Testing**:
- Double-click to edit: Input covers full rectangle ✓
- Long text (50+ chars): Displays from left, not center ✓
- Text selection: Select-all works correctly ✓
- Save (Enter) and cancel (Escape): Still work as before ✓
- Click outside to save: Still works ✓
- Border radius: Properly rounded with new dimensions ✓

### Session 9 Continued: Fix Rectangle Size During Editing

**Problem**: After initial improvements, discovered rectangle wasn't expanding for long text:
- Small nodes worked fine, but larger nodes had editing area that didn't match rectangle size
- Issue occurred even with non-truncated text, suggesting a size cap

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Rectangle sizing bug**: `rectWidth` was calculated from `displayTitle` (potentially truncated), but input received full `task.title`
   - Truncated: "This is a very long task title that n..." → small rectangle
   - Input gets: "This is a very long task title that needs editing" → overflows small box
2. **Potential CSS limitation**: Input elements might have default max-width constraints

**Solution** (lines 3971, 3997):
1. **Dynamic rectangle sizing for edit mode**:
   - Changed: `const rectWidth = Math.max(minWidth, displayTitle.length * charWidth + padding * 2)`
   - To: `const textForSizing = this.editingTaskId === task.id ? task.title : displayTitle;`
   - Then: `const rectWidth = Math.max(minWidth, textForSizing.length * charWidth + padding * 2)`
   - Rectangle now expands to fit **full title** when editing starts

2. **Override CSS width constraints**:
   - Added `max-width: none` to input CSS
   - Prevents any default or inherited max-width from limiting input expansion
   - Ensures input can fill the entire foreignObject width

**How It Works**:
1. User double-clicks truncated text: "This is a very lon..."
2. System calculates `textForSizing = task.title` (full text, not truncated)
3. Rectangle expands to fit full text: `rectWidth` increases
4. ForeignObject expands to match: `width={rectWidth}`
5. Input fills foreignObject with `width: 100%; max-width: none`
6. Result: Editing box perfectly matches the expanded rectangle

**Testing**:
- Truncated text (80+ chars): Rectangle expands on edit ✓
- Non-truncated long text: No size cap, full width ✓
- Very long text (150+ chars): Properly displays and edits ✓
- Small text: Still works as before ✓
- Text that fits exactly: No issues ✓

### Session 9 Final: Fix Cursor Positioning During Edit

**Problem**: When in editing mode, clicking inside the input box to reposition the cursor would immediately save/exit edit mode instead of allowing cursor movement.

**Root Cause**: Event bubbling issue
- Clicks on the input were bubbling up to canvas/SVG mousedown handlers
- Canvas handlers or blur events were triggering `finishEditing()`
- User couldn't click inside the input to reposition cursor

**Solution** (lines 3993-3994, 4007-4008):
1. **Added stopPropagation to foreignObject**:
   - `foreignObject.onmousedown = (e) => e.stopPropagation();`
   - `foreignObject.onclick = (e) => e.stopPropagation();`
   - Prevents clicks on the editing container from reaching canvas handlers

2. **Added stopPropagation to input**:
   - `input.onmousedown = (e) => e.stopPropagation();`
   - `input.onclick = (e) => e.stopPropagation();`
   - Prevents clicks inside the input from reaching canvas handlers

**How It Works Now**:
- **Click inside input**: Event stops at input level, cursor repositions, editing continues
- **Click outside input**: Event reaches canvas, blur triggers, editing finishes and saves
- **Enter key**: Still immediately saves
- **Escape key**: Still cancels without saving

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Can click anywhere inside the input box to move cursor
- ✅ Can select text by clicking and dragging
- ✅ Can reposition cursor without accidentally exiting edit mode
- ✅ Still exits edit mode when clicking outside (as expected)
- ✅ Natural text editing experience

**Testing**:
- Click inside input to reposition cursor: Works, stays in edit mode ✓
- Click and drag to select text: Works, stays in edit mode ✓
- Click at start/middle/end of text: Cursor moves correctly ✓
- Click outside input box: Exits edit mode and saves ✓
- Enter/Escape keys: Still work as before ✓

### Session 10: Multiline Text Support (MAJOR FEATURE)

**Overview**: Implemented comprehensive multiline text support, enabling tasks to display rich, wrapped text across multiple lines instead of being constrained to single lines.

**New Configuration Settings** (5 new settings):
1. **enableMultiline**: Master toggle (default: true)
2. **maxNodeWidth**: Maximum width before wrapping (default: 600px, range: 100-2000)
3. **maxNodeHeight**: Optional height limit (default: 0 = unlimited, range: 0-1000)
4. **lineHeight**: Spacing between lines (default: 20px, range: 12-40)
5. **wordWrap**: Wrap on words vs characters (default: true)

**Core Implementation**:

1. **wrapText() Function** (lines 2132-2188):
   - Intelligently splits text into lines based on maxNodeWidth and charWidth
   - Word wrap mode: Breaks on spaces for readability
   - Character wrap mode: Fixed-width breaking
   - Handles edge case: very long words force character breaks
   - Returns array of line strings

2. **Dynamic Rectangle Sizing** (lines 4067-4087):
   - **Width**: `Math.max(minWidth, Math.min(maxNodeWidth, longestLineWidth))`
   - **Height**: `lines.length × lineHeight + padding × 2`
   - Respects maxNodeHeight if set (shows overflow indicator)
   - Calculates dimensions for each node individually

3. **SVG Multiline Rendering** (lines 4131-4166):
   - Replaced single `<text>` element with `<text>` + multiple `<tspan>` children
   - Each line rendered as separate tspan element
   - Left-aligned text (changed from center) for readability
   - Vertical positioning: `yOffset = -rectHeight/2 + padding + lineHeight × (index + 0.75)`
   - Emoji indicators (🔄/✅) on first line only
   - Overflow indicator "..." if text exceeds maxNodeHeight

4. **Textarea Editor** (lines 4110-4131):
   - Replaced `<input>` with `<textarea>` for multiline editing
   - **Keyboard Shortcuts** (Session 14: Updated to modern UX):
     - **Enter** → Saves edits (intuitive!)
     - **Shift+Enter** → Creates newline
     - **Escape** → Cancels without saving
   - Dynamic rows: `Math.max(2, lines.length)`
   - Resize disabled, scroll enabled

5. **Settings UI Integration** (lines 2300-2336):
   - Added 5 new configuration options to settings modal
   - Clear labels and descriptions
   - Proper validation (min/max ranges)

6. **Persistence** (lines 4600-4604, 4632-4636, 4690-4694):
   - All settings saved to localStorage
   - Proper defaults using null-coalescing operator (??)
   - Backward compatible (existing data works)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Rich task descriptions without truncation
- ✅ Natural text wrapping maintains readability
- ✅ Configurable constraints prevent oversized nodes
- ✅ Left-aligned text improves multiline readability
- ✅ Word wrap prevents awkward mid-word breaks
- ✅ Textarea editing supports manual newlines
- ✅ Can be toggled off for single-line behavior

**Known Limitations** (Non-Critical):
- Other sizing locations (preview nodes, links) not yet updated - use single-line sizing
- Arrow endpoints use old heights but still functional
- Badge/lock positioning may need adjustment for very tall nodes

**Testing**:
- Short text (1 line): Works as before ✓
- Medium text (2-3 lines): Wraps correctly ✓
- Long text (100+ chars): Wraps with word boundaries ✓
- Very long single word: Force breaks correctly ✓
- Textarea editing: Enter saves, Shift+Enter adds newline ✓
- Settings: All options accessible and functional ✓
- Persistence: Settings save/load correctly ✓

**User Experience**:
- Tasks can now contain descriptive text like: "Implement user authentication using JWT tokens with refresh token rotation and secure HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security"
- Text wraps naturally at word boundaries
- Editing feels natural with standard textarea behavior
- Visual hierarchy maintained with dynamic heights

### Session 10 Continued: Critical Multiline Bug Fixes

**Issue 1: Settings Modal Not Scrollable**

**Problem**: With 5 new multiline settings added, the Settings modal content exceeded viewport height but couldn't scroll. Users couldn't access "Max Node Height" and other bottom settings.

**Solution** (line 1052):
- Added `max-height: 80vh` to settings modal content
- Added `overflow-y: auto` to enable vertical scrolling
- Modal now scrolls smoothly when content is tall

**Issue 2: Multiline Stuck at 2 Lines (CRITICAL BUG)**

**Problem**: Despite implementing multiline support, task nodes were stuck at 1-2 lines regardless of text length. Setting `maxNodeHeight: 0` (unlimited) had no effect.

**Root Cause** (line 4074):
- The code was using `displayTitle` (truncated text) for wrapping calculations
- `displayTitle` is truncated at `textLengthThreshold` (default 60 chars)
- So a 200-char task would:
  1. Get truncated to 60 chars + "..."
  2. Wrap the 60-char version at 600px width
  3. Result: Only 1-2 lines displayed
- The multiline wrapping was working correctly, but it was wrapping the WRONG text (truncated version)

**Solution** (line 4074):
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const textForSizing = this.editingTaskId === task.id ? task.title : displayTitle;

// AFTER (fixed):
const textForSizing = this.editingTaskId === task.id || this.enableMultiline ? task.title : displayTitle;
```

**Logic**:
- When multiline is enabled → use full `task.title` for wrapping
- When multiline is disabled → use truncated `displayTitle` (backward compatible)
- When editing → always use full `task.title`
- Let `maxNodeHeight` handle limiting display (with "..." overflow indicator)

**Impact**:
- ✅ Long text now properly wraps across unlimited lines (when maxNodeHeight = 0)
- ✅ Text can span 10, 20, 50+ lines based on content
- ✅ Word wrap mode respects full text content
- ✅ Old truncation behavior preserved when multiline is disabled
- ✅ No conflict between truncation and multiline features

**Testing**:
- 50-char text: 1-2 lines ✓
- 100-char text: 2-3 lines ✓
- 200-char text: 4-6 lines (was stuck at 2 before) ✓
- 500-char text: 10+ lines (was stuck at 2 before) ✓
- maxNodeHeight = 100px: Properly limits with "..." indicator ✓
- Disable multiline: Falls back to truncation ✓

### Session 10 Final: Arrow Positioning & Text Clipping Fixes

**Issue 3: Arrow Positioning Broken for Multiline Nodes (CRITICAL BUG)**

**Problem**: When nodes exceeded 1 line, arrows would either penetrate inside the rectangles or end too far away, creating visual disconnection.

**Root Cause**: Arrow endpoint calculations were using hardcoded `rectHeight = 40` at 3 locations:
- Line 3889: Main parent links
- Line 3969: Other parent links
- Line 4015: Dependency links

These hardcoded values didn't account for dynamic multiline heights, so arrows always aimed for single-line box edges even when boxes were 3, 5, 10+ lines tall.

**Solution** (lines 4321-4350, 3881-3882, 3953-3954, 3991-3992):

1. **Created helper function** `calculateTaskDimensions(task)`:
   - Centralizes dimension calculation logic
   - Returns `{rectWidth, rectHeight, lines}` accounting for multiline
   - Uses same logic as main node rendering for consistency

2. **Updated all 3 arrow positioning locations**:
   ```javascript
   // BEFORE (broken):
   const rectHeight = 40;
   const arrowEnd = this.getLineEndAtRectEdge(parent.x, parent.y, task.x, task.y, rectWidth, rectHeight);

   // AFTER (fixed):
   const { rectWidth, rectHeight } = this.calculateTaskDimensions(task);
   const arrowEnd = this.getLineEndAtRectEdge(parent.x, parent.y, task.x, task.y, rectWidth, rectHeight);
   ```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Arrows now accurately target rectangle edges regardless of node height
- ✅ Parent links, other-parent links, and dependency links all work correctly
- ✅ Works with any lineHeight, maxNodeHeight, or text length
- ✅ Visual clarity maintained as nodes grow

**Issue 4: Text Overflow with maxNodeHeight (CRITICAL BUG)**

**Problem**: When `maxNodeHeight` was set (e.g., 100px), text would overflow outside the rectangle boundary instead of being clipped. All lines were rendered even if they extended beyond the box.

**Root Cause** (lines 4129-4138):
- Code rendered ALL lines in the `lines` array with `lines.forEach()`
- SVG doesn't clip content by default - text outside viewBox is still visible
- Even though `rectHeight` was capped by `maxNodeHeight`, tspan elements positioned outside the boundary were still rendered

**Solution** (lines 4128-4155):

1. **Calculate visible line capacity**:
   ```javascript
   const availableHeight = rectHeight - padding * 2;
   const maxVisibleLines = Math.floor(availableHeight / this.lineHeight);
   const linesToRender = isOverflowing ? Math.min(lines.length, maxVisibleLines - 1) : lines.length;
   ```

2. **Render only lines that fit**:
   - Changed from `lines.forEach()` to `for (let index = 0; index < linesToRender; index++)`
   - When overflowing, reserve space for ellipsis by rendering `maxVisibleLines - 1` lines
   - When not overflowing, render all lines

3. **Position ellipsis correctly**:
   ```javascript
   const ellipsisY = -rectHeight / 2 + padding + this.lineHeight * (linesToRender + 0.75);
   ```
   - Ellipsis appears as the last visible line within the rectangle
   - Clear visual indicator that content continues below

**Impact**:
- ✅ Text properly contained within rectangle boundaries
- ✅ maxNodeHeight setting now works as intended
- ✅ No visual overflow or text bleeding outside boxes
- ✅ "..." ellipsis indicates truncated content
- ✅ Maintains clean visual hierarchy

**Testing**:
- Short text + no maxNodeHeight: Normal display ✓
- Long text + no maxNodeHeight: All lines visible ✓
- Long text + maxNodeHeight 100px: Truncates with "..." ✓
- Long text + maxNodeHeight 200px: More lines visible ✓
- Arrows connect to correct edges for all heights ✓

### Session 10 Continued: Height Expansion & Truncation Improvements

**Issue 5: Ellipsis Removed Entire Last Line + Extra Rectangle Height**

**Problems**:
1. **Entire line removed**: When overflowing, the last line was completely removed and replaced with "..." as a separate line. Users lost an entire line of text (e.g., "Line 4 with lots of text" → gone, "..." on line 5).
2. **Wasted rectangle space**: Rectangle height was set to `maxNodeHeight` even when fewer lines were rendered, creating empty space at the bottom.

**Root Causes**:
1. Code rendered `maxVisibleLines - 1` text lines, then added "..." as separate tspan → entire last line lost
2. Rectangle sized to `Math.min(maxNodeHeight, calculatedHeight)` without considering actual rendered lines

**Solution** (lines 4068-4081, 4143-4167):

**Fix 1: Truncate Last Line Mid-Text (Not Remove It)**
```javascript
// Render ALL visible lines (not minus 1)
const linesToRender = Math.min(lines.length, maxVisibleLines);

for (let index = 0; index < linesToRender; index++) {
    let lineText = lines[index];

    // If last visible line and overflowing, truncate IT
    if (isOverflowing && index === linesToRender - 1) {
        lineText = lineText.slice(0, -3) + '...'; // Replace last 3 chars with ...
    }

    // Render tspan with lineText (includes truncated last line)
}
```

**Fix 2: Size Rectangle to Actual Rendered Content**
```javascript
// Calculate how many lines will actually render
let actualRenderedLines = lines.length;
if (isOverflowing) {
    const availableHeightForOverflow = this.maxNodeHeight - padding * 2;
    actualRenderedLines = Math.floor(availableHeightForOverflow / this.lineHeight);
}

// Size rectangle based on actual content (no wasted space)
const rectHeight = (this.maxNodeHeight > 0 && !shouldFullyExpand)
    ? actualRenderedLines * this.lineHeight + padding * 2
    : calculatedHeight;
```

**How It Works Now**:
- maxNodeHeight allows 5 lines → render all 5 lines, last line ends with "..."
- Example: "Line 5 with some long text here" → "Line 5 with some long te..."
- Rectangle height = exactly 5 lines worth of space (no wasted height)
- User sees maximum content within the constraint

**Preserves Expansion Behavior**:
- Editing/selecting/working still bypasses `maxNodeHeight` via `shouldFullyExpand`
- Only affects non-expanded nodes
- Auto-expansion logic completely untouched

**Issue 6: No Height Expansion When Editing**

**Problem**: When editing long text with maxNodeHeight set, the textarea only showed truncated text, making editing difficult. Users couldn't see what they were typing beyond the height limit.

**Solution** (lines 4062-4073):
- Added `shouldFullyExpand` flag that checks:
  - `this.editingTaskId === task.id` → editing mode
  - `this.selectedTaskIds.has(task.id)` → selected state
  - `shouldExpand` → already expanded (currentlyWorking, textLocked)
- Bypass maxNodeHeight when `shouldFullyExpand === true`
- Rectangle expands to show ALL lines when editing

**Issue 7: No Height Expansion When Selected**

**Problem**: When selecting a truncated node to lock it (for expanded text), users couldn't see the full text or easily access the lock button.

**Solution**: Same `shouldFullyExpand` logic (line 4066)
- Selection now triggers full height expansion
- Users can see complete text before locking
- Lock button is accessible for truncated nodes
- Natural workflow: select → see full text → lock if desired

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Maximum text visible within height constraints
- ✅ Editing shows all text for easier modifications
- ✅ Selection shows all text for review before locking
- ✅ Natural workflow for lock button usage
- ✅ No wasted vertical space

**Behavior Summary**:
- **Normal state + maxNodeHeight set**: Shows max lines with "..." at bottom
- **Editing**: Auto-expands to show ALL lines (ignores maxNodeHeight)
- **Selected**: Auto-expands to show ALL lines (ignores maxNodeHeight)
- **Working/Locked**: Already expands via existing shouldExpand logic
- **No maxNodeHeight (0)**: Always shows all lines

**Testing**:
- maxNodeHeight 100px, 200-char text: Shows all 5 lines, last truncated with "..." ✓
- Last line truncated mid-text (not removed): "long text he..." ✓
- Rectangle height matches content exactly (no wasted space) ✓
- Ellipsis positioned within rectangle bounds ✓
- Double-click to edit: Expands to show all lines ✓
- Click to select: Expands to show all lines ✓
- Lock button accessible after selection ✓
- Finish editing: Returns to truncated state ✓

### Session 11: Curved Arrow Styling

**Feature Request**: "How hard would it be to implement different arrow pathing styles? Like curvy, straight, rectangular if you catch my drift"

**Implemented**: Curved arrow styling system with user-configurable options

**What Was Added**:

1. **Arrow Style Setting** (lines 1141-1142):
   - New configuration: `arrowStyle: 'straight' | 'curved'` (default: 'straight')
   - New configuration: `arrowCurvature: 0.05-0.5` (default: 0.25)
   - Backward compatible - existing users keep straight arrows

2. **Curved Path Renderer** (lines 4408-4440):
   ```javascript
   createCurvedPath(x1, y1, x2, y2, className) {
       // Calculate curve control points
       const dx = x2 - x1;
       const dy = y2 - y1;
       const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

       // Curve intensity based on distance and user setting
       const curveAmount = distance * this.arrowCurvature;

       // Create perpendicular offset for smooth curve
       const angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);
       const perpAngle = angle + Math.PI / 2;

       // Control points offset perpendicular to the line
       const offsetX = Math.cos(perpAngle) * curveAmount;
       const offsetY = Math.sin(perpAngle) * curveAmount;

       // Midpoint for control
       const midX = (x1 + x2) / 2;
       const midY = (y1 + y2) / 2;

       // Quadratic bezier curve through offset midpoint
       const d = `M ${x1} ${y1} Q ${midX + offsetX} ${midY + offsetY}, ${x2} ${y2}`;

       return path; // SVG <path> element
   }
   ```

3. **Smart Dispatch System** (lines 4392-4406):
   - Refactored `createLine()` to dispatch based on `arrowStyle` setting
   - Returns `<line>` for straight, `<path>` for curved
   - No changes needed at call sites - all 7 arrow creation points work automatically:
     - Main parent links (visible + hit detection)
     - Other parent links (visible + hit detection)
     - Dependency links (visible + hit detection)
     - Temporary drag preview line

4. **Settings UI** (lines 2397-2415):
   - **Arrow Style**: Dropdown with "Straight" and "Curved" options
   - **Arrow Curvature**: Slider from 0.05 (subtle) to 0.5 (dramatic)
   - Live preview: Change setting, click Apply, see results immediately

5. **Persistence** (lines 4788-4789, 4822-4823, 4882-4883):
   - Arrow settings saved to localStorage
   - Properly loaded with defaults using null-coalescing operator
   - Survives page refresh

**Technical Details**:

**Quadratic Bezier Curves**:
- Uses SVG `Q` command: `M x1 y1 Q controlX controlY, x2 y2`
- Control point perpendicular to line direction for smooth, natural curves
- Curve intensity scales with distance (longer arrows = more curve)

**Why Perpendicular Offset**:
- Curves sideways relative to line direction
- Creates organic, flowing appearance
- Avoids awkward curves that bend backward

**Hit Detection**:
- Curved paths use same class system as straight lines
- Wide invisible paths for click detection
- Thin visible paths for display

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Beautiful, organic visual style
- ✅ Reduces visual clutter in complex graphs
- ✅ Easier to trace relationships
- ✅ User-configurable intensity
- ✅ Zero performance impact (simple math)
- ✅ Works with all existing features (golden paths, selection, etc.)

**User Control**:
- **Straight arrows** (default): Clean, minimal, direct
- **Curved arrows** (0.05-0.5): Organic, flowing, less visual noise
- **Curvature slider**: Fine-tune curve intensity to preference

**Testing**:
- Switch between straight and curved: Settings apply immediately ✓
- Curvature slider 0.05: Subtle curves ✓
- Curvature slider 0.5: Dramatic curves ✓
- Golden path highlighting: Works with curved arrows ✓
- Hit detection: Click curved arrows to select ✓
- Dependency creation (Alt+drag): Works with curved style ✓
- Persistence: Setting survives refresh ✓

**Future Potential**:
- Orthogonal/Manhattan routing (rectangular paths) - complex algorithm, better for auto-layout
- Per-link styling (e.g., curved parents, straight dependencies)
- Animation along curved paths

### Session 11 Continued: Bug Fixes

**Issue 1: Node Padding Affecting Height**

**Problem**: The "Node Padding" setting (intended for left/right padding) was incorrectly affecting node height, causing height to change when adjusting horizontal padding.

**Root Cause** (lines 4082, 4102, 4168, 4188, 4364):
- `nodePadding` was being used for both horizontal AND vertical padding calculations
- Changing horizontal padding slider affected rectangle height
- Confusing UX - padding setting had unexpected effects

**Solution**:
- Introduced fixed `verticalPadding = 10` for all height calculations
- `nodePadding` now only affects horizontal (left/right) spacing
- Clear separation of concerns

**Changes**:
- Lines 4083-4104: Use `verticalPadding` for height calculations
- Lines 4168, 4188: Use `verticalPadding` for text vertical positioning
- Line 4364: Use `verticalPadding` in `calculateTaskDimensions()`

**Issue 2: Curved Arrow Settings Not Applying**

**Problem**: Changing "Arrow Style" from Straight to Curved and clicking "Apply" had no effect. Setting didn't persist or apply.

**Root Cause** (line 2528):
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
else if (def.type === 'select') {
    this[key] = parseInt(input.value); // Forces to integer!
}
```
- Code assumed ALL select inputs have numeric values
- `arrowStyle` uses string values ('straight', 'curved')
- `parseInt('straight')` → `NaN` → setting broken

**Solution** (lines 2528-2535):
```javascript
// AFTER (fixed):
else if (def.type === 'select') {
    const firstOptionValue = def.options[0].value;
    if (typeof firstOptionValue === 'number' || !isNaN(parseInt(firstOptionValue))) {
        this[key] = parseInt(input.value); // Numeric selects (e.g., fontWeight)
    } else {
        this[key] = input.value; // String selects (e.g., arrowStyle)
    }
}
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Node padding now only affects horizontal spacing (as intended)
- ✅ Arrow style setting applies immediately
- ✅ Arrow curvature slider works correctly
- ✅ Settings persist across refresh
- ✅ Backward compatible with numeric select inputs (fontWeight)

**Testing**:
- Adjust node padding: Only width changes ✓
- Change arrow style to curved: Applies immediately ✓
- Adjust curvature slider: Curves change intensity ✓
- Refresh page: Settings persist ✓

### Session 11 Continued: Updated Default Settings

**Changes**: Updated default settings for better visual appearance and usability.

**New Defaults**:
- **Character Width**: 8 → **8.5** (better spacing for modern fonts)
- **Node Padding**: 15 → **30** (more breathing room inside rectangles)
- **Minimum Node Width**: 80 → **100** (prevents overly narrow nodes)
- **Node Padding Max**: 20 → **50** (allows for more padding customization)

**Rationale**:
- Wider padding creates cleaner, more readable nodes
- Slightly increased character width accounts for font rendering variations
- Higher minimum width prevents cramped appearance
- Changes apply to new users; existing users keep their saved settings

**Updated Files**:
- Lines 1129-1131: App state initialization
- Lines 2308, 2317, 2325: ConfigDefs defaults
- Lines 4880-4882: LoadFromStorage defaults
- README Settings UI section: Updated documentation

### Session 12: Configurable Undo/Redo History

**New Features**: Enhanced undo/redo system with user control and visibility.

**1. Configurable History Limit**:
- Added `maxUndoSteps` to Settings UI (5-200 step range, default: 50)
- Users can now customize undo history size based on their needs and available memory
- Changes apply immediately via `enforceUndoLimit()` method
- Excess snapshots automatically trimmed when limit is reduced

**2. Clear History Button**:
- New "History Management" section in Settings modal
- Shows live stats: undo count, redo count, memory usage estimate
- Red "Clear Undo/Redo History" button with confirmation dialog
- Safely frees up localStorage space when history grows too large

**3. Visual Indicators**:
- Real-time display of undo steps vs limit (e.g., "15 / 50")
- Memory usage estimate calculated from JSON size
- Stats update when Settings modal opens
- Stats refresh after clearing history

**Implementation Details**:
- Line 2416-2424: Added `maxUndoSteps` to configDefs
- Lines 1057-1080: Added History Management section to Settings modal HTML
- Lines 2535-2546: Update history stats when modal opens
- Lines 4736-4742: New `enforceUndoLimit()` method
- Lines 4744-4775: New `clearUndoHistory()` method with confirmation
- Line 2592: Call `enforceUndoLimit()` in `applySettings()`
- Line 4658: Call `enforceUndoLimit()` in `saveSnapshot()`

**Benefits**:
- **Memory Control**: Users with large projects can reduce history to save memory
- **Deep History**: Users who need extensive undo can increase limit up to 200 steps
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into how much storage undo/redo is using
- **Storage Management**: Manual clearing option when localStorage fills up

**Testing Completed**:
- ✓ Change limit from 50 → 20 → Old snapshots trimmed correctly
- ✓ Change limit from 20 → 100 → Can accumulate more snapshots
- ✓ Clear history → Both undo and redo stacks cleared
- ✓ Stats display updates correctly in Settings modal
- ✓ Memory estimate calculated accurately

### Session 12 Continued: Performance Fix for Canvas Panning

**Issue**: Canvas panning caused significant performance degradation due to synchronous localStorage writes on every mouseup event.

**Root Cause**:
- Line 3298 (now 3301) called `saveToStorage()` on every canvas pan mouseup
- Each save serializes the entire app state: all tasks, undo/redo stacks (50+ snapshots each!), settings, homes
- localStorage writes are synchronous and block the main thread
- This created noticeable lag during frequent panning operations

**Solution**: Implemented debounced save mechanism
- Added `debouncedSaveToStorage(delay)` method (lines 4862-4878)
- Waits 500ms after last pan operation before saving
- Prevents excessive writes during rapid interactions
- First pan triggers timer, subsequent pans within 500ms reset timer
- Only saves once after user stops panning

**Implementation Details**:
- Line 1180: Added `saveDebounceTimer` to app state
- Lines 4862-4878: New `debouncedSaveToStorage()` method with clearTimeout logic
- Line 3301: Changed `saveToStorage()` to `debouncedSaveToStorage(500)`
- Debounce delay: 500ms (half-second after last pan)

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: Save on EVERY pan mouseup (could be 10+ times per second during rapid panning)
- **After**: Save once after panning stops (500ms delay)
- **Result**: ~95% reduction in localStorage writes during pan operations
- Eliminates UI lag/stutter during canvas navigation

**Why Canvas Panning Needs Saving**:
Unlike typical viewport navigation, this app's canvas panning actually modifies task positions (lines 3184-3186). All tasks move together when panning, so positions must be persisted. However, we don't need to save on EVERY mousemove - debouncing is perfect for this use case.

**Other Operations Not Affected**:
- Task creation/deletion/editing: Still save immediately (no debounce)
- Undo/redo: Still save immediately
- Settings changes: Still save immediately
- Only canvas panning uses debounced save

**Testing Completed**:
- ✓ Rapid panning: Smooth performance, no stuttering
- ✓ Pan then wait 500ms: Data persists correctly
- ✓ Pan, refresh browser after 500ms: Positions saved
- ✓ Pan, refresh immediately: May lose last pan (acceptable tradeoff)

### Session 13: Home Keybinds for Instant Navigation

**New Feature**: Keyboard shortcuts (0-9) for jumping to home bookmarks.

**Problem**: Accessing homes required opening dropdown menus or context menus, which interrupts workflow.

**Solution**: Add keyboard shortcut support to homes
- Assign number keys 0-9 to any home
- Press assigned key to instantly jump to that home
- Perfect for power users and frequent navigation

**Implementation Details**:

**1. Data Structure Update**:
- Line 1170: Added `keybind` property to homes array comment
- Line 5066: New homes created with `keybind: null` by default
- Keybind stored as string (e.g., "1", "2", "0")

**2. UI for Setting Keybinds** (lines 5252-5318):
- `setKeybindForHome(homeId)` method
- Shows alert modal with instructions
- Captures next keypress using temporary event listener
- Validates only 0-9 keys allowed
- Conflict detection: warns if key already assigned
- Reassignment dialog: allows moving keybind to new home
- Escape key clears existing keybind or cancels

**3. Keyboard Event Handler** (lines 1470-1478):
- Added to main keydown listener (after undo/redo shortcuts)
- Only triggers when NOT editing text
- Only triggers when no modifiers (Ctrl/Cmd/Alt) pressed
- Finds home with matching keybind and calls `jumpToHome()`
- Prevents default to avoid typing numbers

**4. Visual Display**:
- Line 5447: Manage Homes modal shows keybind in details (e.g., "Keybind: 1")
- Line 5480: Keybind button shows "⌨ Set Key" or "⌨ [key]"
- Line 5409: Homes dropdown shows keybind next to name (e.g., "Work [1]")
- Line 3759: Context menu submenu shows keybind (e.g., "Work [1]")

**Keybind Management Features**:
- **Conflict Detection**: Warns when key already assigned to another home
- **Reassignment**: User can choose to move keybind from old home to new
- **Clear Keybind**: Press Escape to remove assigned keybind
- **Visual Feedback**: Keybinds displayed everywhere homes are shown
- **Button Label**: Shows current keybind on button (e.g., "⌨ 5")

**User Experience**:
- **Fast Navigation**: Single keypress to jump anywhere
- **No Menu Friction**: Direct access without opening dropdowns
- **Visual Discovery**: Keybinds shown in all menus for learning
- **Power User Friendly**: Up to 10 homes can have instant access
- **Conflict Safe**: Prevents accidental overwrites with confirmation

**Use Cases**:
- Frontend dev → Press 1, Backend → Press 2, Docs → Press 3
- Personal: Work → 1, Home → 2, Goals → 3
- Large graphs: Different project areas mapped to number keys
- Presentation mode: Key milestones on 1-9 for quick demos

**Testing Completed**:
- ✓ Assign keybind to home → Press number → Jumps correctly
- ✓ Conflict detection → Shows dialog with reassignment option
- ✓ Clear keybind with Escape → Removes keybind successfully
- ✓ Keybinds display in dropdown, context menu, manage modal
- ✓ Keybinds don't trigger while editing text
- ✓ Keybinds don't conflict with Ctrl+1 (fit all)

**Dark Mode Fix** (lines 5523-5536):
- Fixed text visibility in Manage Homes modal for dark mode
- Home names now use `#e2e8f0` (light slate) in dark mode instead of `#333`
- Details text uses `#94a3b8` (slate gray) in dark mode instead of `#666`
- Dynamically checks `document.body.classList.contains('dark-mode')`
- Origin Home purple color (#9c27b0) maintained in both modes for consistency

### Session 13 Continued: Jump to Home Save Fix

**Bug**: Camera position after jumping to home via keybind was not being saved to localStorage.

**Root Cause**:
- Line 5193 (old): `saveToStorage()` called immediately after starting animation
- Task positions modified INSIDE animation callback (lines 5151-5154)
- Save happened BEFORE positions changed, so new positions were never persisted
- On page reload, positions would revert to pre-jump state

**Solution**:
- Moved `saveToStorage()` from line 5193 to line 5187
- Now saves inside animation complete callback (when elapsed >= totalDuration)
- Ensures all position changes and zoom changes are saved AFTER animation finishes
- Toast notification still shows immediately for better UX

**Impact**:
- Both animated jumps (with keybinds) and instant jumps now persist correctly
- Positions maintained across page reloads
- No more lost navigation state

**Testing**:
- ✓ Jump to home via keybind → Refresh page → Position persists
- ✓ Animation completes → Positions saved
- ✓ Non-animated jumps still work correctly

### Session 13 Continued: Removed Reset View Feature

**Removed Feature**: "Reset View" button and functionality

**Reason**: The Reset View feature had problematic behavior:
- When no "Origin Home" existed, it would scatter all tasks randomly around screen center
- This would completely ruin carefully arranged task layouts
- Destructive operation that couldn't be easily undone (though undo system could recover)
- Users found it more harmful than helpful

**What Was Removed**:
- Line 991 (old): "Reset View" button from toolbar
- Line 3718 (old): "Reset View" entry from right-click context menu
- Lines 4608-4628 (old): `resetView()` function entirely

**Alternative Solution**:
- Users can still jump to "Origin Home" via:
  - Homes dropdown → Click "Origin Home"
  - Assign a keybind to "Origin Home" (e.g., press 0)
  - Right-click menu → Homes submenu → "Origin Home"
- "Mark Origin" button still exists and works as before
- If users want to reset their view, they can:
  1. Mark their current position as "Origin Home"
  2. Jump to it using keybind or dropdown
  - This is intentional and controlled, not destructive

**Impact**:
- Removed destructive task repositioning behavior
- Preserved "Origin Home" functionality through Homes system
- Cleaner, safer UX without unexpected task movement

### Session 14: Dynamic Text Input Resizing

**New Feature**: Textbox and rectangle now resize dynamically as you type during inline editing.

**Problem**:
- Previously, when editing a task, the rectangle and textarea had fixed dimensions
- If you typed more text, it would scroll within the fixed box
- If you deleted text, the box stayed the same large size
- Awkward editing experience, especially for multiline text

**Solution**: Real-time dynamic resizing
- Rectangle and textarea expand/contract as you type
- Grows wider when text exceeds current width
- Grows taller when adding newlines or wrapping text
- Shrinks when deleting text (respects min/max constraints)
- Natural editing experience like modern text editors

**Implementation Details**:

**1. Extracted Sizing Logic** (lines 2172-2198):
- New `calculateTextBoxDimensions(text)` helper method
- Takes text string, returns `{ rectWidth, rectHeight, lines }`
- Reusable by both initial render and dynamic resizing
- Applies all configuration constraints (minNodeWidth, maxNodeWidth, maxNodeHeight, lineHeight, nodePadding)

**2. Dynamic Resize Method** (lines 2200-2238):
- New `resizeEditingBox()` method
- Gets current textarea value
- Calculates new dimensions using helper
- Updates DOM elements directly:
  - `<rect>` - background rectangle
  - `<foreignObject>` - container for textarea
  - `textarea.rows` - for better UX
- Fast and efficient (no full canvas re-render)

**3. Input Event Handler** (line 4288):
- Added `textarea.oninput = () => this.resizeEditingBox();`
- Triggers on every keystroke
- No debouncing needed - calculations are fast
- Immediate visual feedback

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Width adjustment**: Expands for long single lines, shrinks when deleted
- ✅ **Height adjustment**: Grows with newlines and text wrapping
- ✅ **Min/max constraints**: Respects minNodeWidth, maxNodeWidth, maxNodeHeight
- ✅ **Configuration aware**: Uses charWidth, lineHeight, nodePadding settings
- ✅ **Word wrapping**: Respects wordWrap setting for line breaks
- ✅ **Smooth UX**: No flicker, no focus loss, cursor position maintained

**Benefits**:
- Natural editing experience like Google Docs, Notion, etc.
- Always see full text being edited (no scrolling in tiny box)
- Visual feedback matches final rendered size
- No performance impact (targeted DOM updates only)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Empty text: Shows minimum 2 rows
- Very long single line: Wraps according to maxNodeWidth
- Multiline disabled: Still allows vertical growth for newlines
- Max height reached: Textarea becomes scrollable

**Testing**:
- ✓ Type long text → Rectangle grows horizontally
- ✓ Add newlines → Rectangle grows vertically
- ✓ Delete text → Rectangle shrinks appropriately
- ✓ Respects minNodeWidth (never too small)
- ✓ Respects maxNodeWidth (wraps when exceeded)
- ✓ Respects maxNodeHeight (scrollable when exceeded)
- ✓ Works with all font/padding/spacing settings

### Session 14 Continued: Improved Keyboard Shortcuts for Editing

**Change**: Updated keyboard shortcuts during text editing for more intuitive UX.

**Previous Behavior** (Less Intuitive):
- **Enter** → Creates newline
- **Ctrl+Enter** or **Cmd+Enter** → Saves edit
- **Escape** → Cancels edit

**New Behavior** (Modern UX Pattern):
- **Enter** → Saves edit immediately ✨
- **Shift+Enter** → Creates newline
- **Escape** → Cancels edit

**Rationale**:
This matches the behavior of modern apps like:
- Slack (Enter sends message, Shift+Enter for newline)
- Discord (same pattern)
- GitHub comments (same pattern)
- Google Chat, Teams, etc.

**Benefits**:
1. **More intuitive**: Enter is the natural "submit" key
2. **Faster workflow**: No modifier key needed for common action
3. **Still supports multiline**: Shift+Enter is well-known pattern
4. **Discoverable**: Users try Enter first naturally

**Implementation** (line 4273-4283):
```javascript
if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) {
    // Plain Enter = save
    this.finishEditing(true);
    e.preventDefault();
}
// Shift+Enter falls through to default textarea behavior (newline)
```

**Documentation Updated**:
- README main keyboard shortcuts section (lines 78-81)
- README multiline text implementation (lines 2594-2597)
- README testing checklist (line 2630)

**User Experience Flow**:
```
Before:
1. Double-click task
2. Type "Task title"
3. Press Enter → Oops, newline added
4. Press Ctrl+Enter → Finally saves

After:
1. Double-click task
2. Type "Task title"
3. Press Enter → Saves! ✓

OR for multiline:
1. Double-click task
2. Type "Line 1"
3. Press Shift+Enter → Newline added
4. Type "Line 2"
5. Press Enter → Saves both lines! ✓
```

**Testing**:
- ✓ Type text → Press Enter → Saves immediately
- ✓ Type line 1 → Shift+Enter → Type line 2 → Enter → Both lines saved
- ✓ Type text → Escape → Cancels correctly
- ✓ Type text → Click outside → Saves (unchanged)
- ✓ Empty text → Enter → Saves as "Untitled" (unchanged)

### Session 14 Continued: Preserve Newlines in Task Text

**New Feature**: Newlines entered during editing are now preserved and displayed correctly.

**Problem**:
- User types "Line 1" → Shift+Enter → "Line 2" → Enter to save
- After saving, text displayed as: "Line 1 Line 2" (single line)
- Newlines were lost - appeared as spaces or nothing

**Root Cause**:
- `wrapText()` function split text on spaces for word wrapping
- Never checked for newline characters (`\n`)
- Newlines got treated as regular characters and lost during wrapping

**Solution**: Modified `wrapText()` to respect newlines (lines 2250-2303)

**How It Works**:
1. **First**: Split text by newline characters (`\n`) to get paragraphs
2. **Then**: Apply word wrapping to each paragraph independently
3. **Finally**: Concatenate all wrapped lines together

**Implementation** (lines 2250-2303):
```javascript
// Split by newlines first
const paragraphs = text.split('\n');
const allLines = [];

// Process each paragraph
for (const paragraph of paragraphs) {
    if (paragraph === '') {
        allLines.push('');  // Preserve blank lines
        continue;
    }

    // Apply word wrapping to this paragraph
    // ... existing wrapping logic ...
}

return allLines;
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Preserves user intent**: Explicit newlines (Shift+Enter) are respected
- ✅ **Still wraps text**: Long paragraphs still wrap automatically at max width
- ✅ **Blank lines work**: Double newline creates visual blank line
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Existing tasks without newlines unchanged
- ✅ **Works everywhere**: calculateTextBoxDimensions() uses wrapText(), so sizing updates automatically

**Use Cases**:
```
Task with steps:
"Implement auth
- JWT tokens
- Refresh flow
- Secure cookies"

Displays as:
Implement auth
- JWT tokens
- Refresh flow
- Secure cookies
```

```
Task with blank line:
"Phase 1

Phase 2"

Displays as:
Phase 1
          <-- blank line
Phase 2
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Empty lines: Preserved as blank visual space
- Very long paragraph: Wraps within paragraph boundaries
- Only newlines: Each creates a blank line
- Mixed short and long: Each paragraph wraps independently

**Testing**:
- ✓ Single line → No change
- ✓ Two lines (one newline) → Displays on two lines
- ✓ Multiple lines → All lines preserved
- ✓ Blank lines (double newline) → Visual spacing preserved
- ✓ Long paragraph with newlines → Each paragraph wraps independently
- ✓ Empty text → Handled correctly
- ✓ Dynamic resize during edit → Works with newlines

**Visual Examples**:

Before ❌:
```
Edit: "Buy:\nMilk\nEggs"
Save
Display: "Buy: Milk Eggs"
```

After ✅:
```
Edit: "Buy:\nMilk\nEggs"
Save
Display:
Buy:
Milk
Eggs
```

### Session 15: Context Menu Enhancement (2025-10-26)

**Version**: 1.10.0 (Emoji Context Menus & Nested Home Options)

**Changes**:
1. Added emojis to all context menu items for quick visual identification
2. Converted homes submenu to nested submenus with multiple actions per home

**Problem**: Context menus lacked visual affordances, making it hard to quickly identify actions. Users also needed a quick way to update home positions without going through the manage homes modal.

**Solution**:

**1. Emoji Context Menus** (Lines 3696-3798):
- Single-task menu items now have emojis:
  - ➕ Add Child
  - ✅ Mark Done / ⏸️ Mark Pending
  - ▶️ Start Working / ⏹️ Stop Working
  - 👁️ Show / 🙈 Hide
  - 📂 Show Children / 📦 Hide Children
  - 📋 Copy Text
  - 🗑️ Delete
- Multi-select menu items have emojis:
  - ✅ Mark Done (N)
  - ⏸️ Mark Pending (N)
  - 🙈 Hide Child (N)
  - 🗑️ Delete (N)
- Empty space menu items have emojis:
  - ➕ Create New Task
  - 🔍 Zoom to Fit
  - 🎯 Mark Origin

**2. Nested Home Submenus** (Lines 3830-3870):
- Each home in the Homes submenu now opens a nested submenu with options:
  - 🚀 Jump to Home - Navigate to the saved home position (existing functionality)
  - 📍 Update Home Position - Set home to current camera location (quick update)
- Uses existing `updateHome()` method (line 5299) for updating positions
- Nested submenu appears to the right of home name
- Keybind display still shows: `Home Name [5]`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Faster visual scanning - emojis provide instant action recognition
- ✅ Better accessibility - semantic icons supplement text
- ✅ Quick home updates - no need to open manage modal for position changes
- ✅ Cleaner UX - all home actions accessible from one location

**Testing**:
- ✓ Single-task context menu shows all emojis correctly
- ✓ Multi-task context menu shows emojis with counts
- ✓ Empty space menu shows emojis
- ✓ Homes submenu shows nested options for each home
- ✓ "Jump to Home" navigates correctly
- ✓ "Update Home Position" updates home to current view
- ✓ Keybinds still display correctly in home names

**Implementation Notes**:
- Emojis are Unicode characters, not images - works across all platforms
- Nested submenus use dedicated `.submenu-nested` class (lines 208-235)
  - Uses `position: fixed` instead of `position: absolute` to break out of parent's `overflow: auto` context
  - Dynamic positioning via `getBoundingClientRect()` on mouseenter (lines 3880-3884)
  - Higher z-index (1002) to float above parent submenu
  - Prevents scrollbar issues when nesting menus inside scrollable parents
- All existing functionality preserved, just enhanced with visual indicators

**Technical Fix - Nested Submenu Positioning**:
- **Problem 1**: Initial implementation used `position: absolute` for nested submenus, which caused them to be constrained by the parent submenu's `overflow-y: auto` container, creating unwanted scrollbars
- **Solution 1**: Created `.submenu-nested` class with `position: fixed` and dynamic screen-coordinate positioning, allowing nested menus to float freely above the parent without scroll constraints
- **Problem 2**: CSS :hover rules caused parent submenu to disappear when hovering nested submenu (mouse leaves parent container)
- **Solution 2**: JavaScript handlers force parent submenu display with `submenu.style.display = 'block'` while nested submenu is visible (lines 3924, 3946)
- **Problem 3**: Original click-to-navigate functionality was lost when adding nested submenus
- **Solution 3**: Restored onclick handler on home items to preserve direct navigation (lines 3896-3903), nested submenu only shows on hover

**How It Works Now**:
- **Hover** on home name → Nested submenu appears with options
- **Click** on home name → Navigate directly to that home (original behavior preserved)
- **Move to nested submenu** → Both parent and nested submenus stay visible
- **Click nested option** → Perform action (jump or update home position)

### Session 16: Hyperlinks - Attach URLs to Tasks (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.11.0 (Hyperlink Support)

**Changes**:
1. Added multiple URL/hyperlink support to tasks
2. Auto-detection and extraction of URLs from pasted text
3. Visual link badges with count indicators
4. Context menu integration with nested submenu for multiple links
5. Keyboard shortcuts for quick link access

**Problem**: Users needed a way to attach related resources (GitHub PRs, documentation, Google Docs, local files) to tasks without cluttering the task title text.

**Solution**: Comprehensive hyperlink system with multiple input methods and visual indicators.

**Implementation**:

**1. URL Helper Functions** (Lines 2359-2401):
```javascript
extractURLsFromText(text)     // Extract all URLs using regex
removeURLsFromText(text)      // Strip URLs from visible text
shortenURL(url, maxLength)    // Truncate URLs for display
isValidURL(url)               // Validate http/https/file/mailto protocols
```

**2. Data Model** (Lines 1553, 1588, 3886):
- Added `links: []` array to task object
- Stores multiple URL strings per task
- Auto-persists via existing localStorage system

**3. Auto-Detection** (Lines 2211-2234 in `finishEditing()`):
- When saving edited text, extracts all URLs using regex pattern:
  - `/(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)|(file:\/\/\/[^\s]+)|(mailto:[^\s]+)/gi`
- Removes URLs from visible title text
- Adds to `task.links` array (prevents duplicates)
- Shows toast: "🔗 Added N link(s)"
- Handles multiple URLs in one paste

**4. Visual Badge** (Lines 4482-4522 in `render()`):
- Blue badge in top-right corner of nodes with links
- Shows `🔗` for single link or `🔗 N` for multiple
- Tooltip on hover displays all links (shortened)
- Styled with drop shadow for depth
- Dark mode support (#1e88e5)

**5. Context Menu Integration** (Lines 3877-3968):
- **No links**: "📎 Attach Link" button
- **One link**:
  - "🔗 Go to Link" (direct open)
  - "📎 Attach Another Link"
  - "❌ Remove Link"
- **Multiple links**:
  - "🔗 Links (N)" with nested submenu
  - Each link shown as "🌐 [shortened URL]"
  - Hover to expand, click to open
  - "📎 Attach Another Link"
  - "🗑️ Remove All Links"
- Uses same nested submenu pattern as Homes feature

**6. Link Management Functions** (Lines 4121-4176):
```javascript
attachLink(taskId)           // Prompt for URL, validate, add to array
openLink(url)                // Open in new tab with security flags
removeAllLinks(taskId)       // Clear all links with confirmation
```

**7. Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- **Ctrl+K** (Lines 1529-1538): Attach link to selected task
  - Shows warning if multiple tasks selected
- **Ctrl+Double-Click** (Lines 1270-1279, 4777-4785): Open first link
  - Falls through to edit if no links exist
  - Works on both main and text double-click handlers

**8. Security & Best Practices**:
- Links open with `window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer')`
- URL validation checks protocol whitelist
- No XSS vulnerabilities (URLs not inserted into DOM as HTML)
- Trailing punctuation stripped from auto-detected URLs

**9. UI/UX Details**:
- **Shortened URLs**: Display format removes protocol, truncates to 30 chars
  - Example: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/pull/123` → `github.com/anthropic...`
- **Badge Positioning**: Top-right corner, doesn't overlap text or hidden count
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Warning toast if URL already exists
- **Empty Links Handling**: Badge only appears if links array has items
- **Undo/Redo Support**: All link operations create snapshots

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Keep task titles clean and focused
- ✅ Attach unlimited URLs per task
- ✅ Support multiple protocols (web, local files, email)
- ✅ Quick access via Ctrl+Double-Click or context menu
- ✅ Visual indicator shows which tasks have links
- ✅ Auto-extraction makes adding links effortless
- ✅ Nested submenu handles many links gracefully

**Use Cases**:

### Session 17: Clickable Link Badges & UX Refinements (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.11.1 (Link Badge Interaction)

**Changes**:
1. Removed Ctrl+Double-Click link opening functionality
2. Fixed link badge positioning to stay within node bounds
3. Made link badge clickable with smart behavior
4. Added dropdown menu for multiple links
5. Updated keyboard shortcuts display

**Problem**: User wanted more intuitive interaction with link badges - clicking the badge should open links directly, and the badge was protruding outside node boundaries.

**Solution**: Made badge fully interactive with context-aware behavior and proper positioning.

**Implementation**:

**1. Removed Ctrl+Double-Click** (Lines 1270-1283, 4767-4777):
- Removed the `e.ctrlKey` check from both double-click handlers
- Double-click now only supports:
  - Normal: Edit task name
  - Shift: Hide/show node within parent
- Updated keyboard shortcuts display (Line 1052) to remove Ctrl+Double-Click

**2. Fixed Badge Positioning** (Lines 4646-4649):
- Changed calculation: `badgeX = rectWidth / 2 - badgeWidth - 3`
- Badge now stays 3px inside the right edge (was protruding outside)
- Badge positioned 3px inside the top edge for consistent margins
- Width varies: 20px for single link, 28px for multiple links

**3. Clickable Badge** (Lines 4685-4697):
- Added onclick handler to badge group
- **Single link**: Calls `this.openLink(task.links[0])` directly
- **Multiple links**: Calls `this.showLinksDropdown(task.id, rect.left, rect.bottom)`
- Used `getBoundingClientRect()` for accurate screen coordinates
- Event propagation stopped to prevent interference

**4. Links Dropdown** (Lines 4269-4336):
```javascript
showLinksDropdown(taskId, x, y)   // Show dropdown at screen coordinates
closeLinksDropdown()               // Clean up dropdown
```
- Creates fixed-position dropdown at badge location
- Each link displayed as clickable item with shortened URL
- Hover effect: Light gray background (#f0f0f0)
- Click outside to close (event listener with setTimeout)
- Auto-closes when link is clicked
- Tooltip shows full URL on each item

**5. Dark Mode Support** (Lines 970-988):
- `.links-dropdown` base styling
- Dark mode: #2a2a2a background, #444 borders
- Hover: #333 background
- All with !important for inline styles

**6. Integration with closeMenu()** (Line 4202):
- `closeMenu()` now calls `closeLinksDropdown()`
- Ensures all popups close together

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Faster access - one click to open link (vs right-click → menu → click)
- ✅ More intuitive - badge looks clickable, now it is
- ✅ Better positioning - badge stays within visual node bounds
- ✅ Cleaner shortcuts - removed redundant Ctrl+Double-Click
- ✅ Dropdown UX - clear visual hierarchy for multiple links

**Testing**:
- ✓ Single link: Click badge → Opens immediately
- ✓ Multiple links: Click badge → Dropdown appears below
- ✓ Dropdown: Shows all links with shortened URLs
- ✓ Dropdown: Click link → Opens and closes dropdown
- ✓ Dropdown: Click outside → Closes dropdown
- ✓ Badge positioning: Stays within node bounds with 3px margin
- ✓ Dark mode: Dropdown styled correctly
- ✓ Context menu: Still shows link options
- ✓ Keyboard shortcuts: Updated display removes Ctrl+Double-Click

**Line Count**: ~6400 lines in task-tree.html (+200 lines)

### Session 18: Git Commit Workflow Documentation (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.11.1 (Documentation Update)

**Changes**:
1. Added "Git Commit Workflow" section to CLAUDE.md
2. Updated README.md Development History

**Problem**: User wanted Claude Code to automatically stage all changes and commit after user confirms changes are working and stable.

**Solution**: Added formal workflow documentation in CLAUDE.md to establish clear git commit protocol.

**Implementation**:

**1. New Section in CLAUDE.md** (Lines 34-64):
- Added "💾 Git Commit Workflow" section after the Critical Workflow Rule
- Specifies 3-step process: Stage all (`git add .`), Commit with conventional format, Include co-author footer
- Conventional commit types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
- Co-Author footer template with Claude Code attribution
- Clear "When to commit" rules:
  - ✅ User explicitly confirms: "looks good", "works perfectly", "stable", "commit this"
  - ✅ Feature is fully implemented and tested
  - ❌ NEVER commit without user confirmation
  - ❌ NEVER commit if tests are failing or errors exist

**2. Documentation Update** (README.md this session):
- Added Session 18 entry to Development History
- Documented the CLAUDE.md update for continuity

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear protocol for when to commit changes
- ✅ Ensures only stable, verified changes enter git history
- ✅ Consistent commit message format across sessions
- ✅ Proper attribution with co-author footer
- ✅ Prevents premature commits of unstable code

**Workflow Impact**:
This establishes a formal handoff: Claude makes changes → User tests and confirms → Claude commits with proper message format. This ensures git history remains clean and all commits represent stable milestones.

### Session 19: Priority Management Feature (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.12.0 (Priority System)

**Changes**:
1. Added priority property to task data model
2. Implemented setPriority() and cyclePriority() functions
3. Added visual priority badge (colored dot) in top-left corner
4. Added "Set Priority" submenu to right-click context menu
5. Added 'P' keyboard shortcut to cycle priority
6. Integrated priority display in status bar
7. Updated help text with new keyboard shortcut

**Problem**: User wanted the ability to mark certain tasks as higher priority to help decide what to work on next.

**Solution**: Implemented a 3-level priority system (High/Medium/Normal) with visual badges, intuitive controls, and full integration across the app.

**Implementation**:

**1. Data Model** (Lines 1595, 1631, 3198):
- Added `priority: 'normal'` property to all task creation points
- Values: `'high'`, `'medium'`, `'normal'`
- Defaults to `'normal'` for all new tasks

**2. Core Functions** (Lines 1801-1828):
- `setPriority(taskId, priority)`: Sets task priority with undo support
  - Saves snapshot with task title and priority level
  - Shows toast notification with emoji (🔴/🟠/⚪)
  - Persists to storage and re-renders
- `cyclePriority(taskId)`: Cycles normal → medium → high → normal
  - Calls setPriority() internally for consistency

**3. Visual Badge** (Lines 4968-4984):
- Colored dot (6px radius) in top-left corner
- Position: 3px from left edge, 3px from top edge
- Colors: #f44336 (red) for high, #ff9800 (orange) for medium
- White stroke with drop shadow for visibility
- Only renders for high/medium priority (normal = no badge)

**4. Right-Click Menu** (Lines 3929-3930, 3967-4037):
- Added "Set Priority" submenu with current priority emoji
- Submenu shows three options: High/Medium/Normal
- Current priority marked with ✓ checkmark and bold text
- Hover mechanics match existing submenu pattern (Links, Homes)
- Fixed positioning with mouseenter/mouseleave handlers

**5. Keyboard Shortcut** (Lines 1447-1452):
- Press `P` (or `p`) to cycle priority of selected task(s)
- Only works when not editing and tasks are selected
- Prevents default to avoid typing 'p' in edit mode
- Multi-select support: cycles all selected tasks

**6. Status Bar Integration** (Lines 1881-1882):
- Priority emoji (🔴/🟠) appears after working task title
- Shows at-a-glance priority of current work
- Only displays for high/medium priority tasks

**7. Help Text Update** (Line 1072):
- Added "P: priority" to keyboard shortcuts display
- Positioned between "Ctrl+K: attach link" and "Shift+Drag: subtree"

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Visual clarity - colored dots immediately show priority at a glance
- ✅ Quick access - Right-click menu or keyboard shortcut (P)
- ✅ Multi-select support - Set priority on multiple tasks at once
- ✅ Status bar integration - See priority of working task
- ✅ Undo/redo support - All priority changes tracked
- ✅ Dark mode compatible - Badges visible in both themes
- ✅ Minimal visual clutter - Only high/medium tasks show badges

**Use Cases**:
- Mark critical blockers as high priority (red dot)
- Highlight time-sensitive tasks (orange dot)
- Visual aid for deciding what to work on next
- Project triage and task organization
- Focus attention on important work in large graphs

**Design Choices**:
- 3 levels instead of 5: Simple, clear, easy to remember
- Colored dots instead of numbers: Visual, non-intrusive, international
- Red/Orange/None: Semantic colors (red = urgent, orange = important)
- Top-left corner: Doesn't interfere with other badges (lock, hidden count, link)
- Cycle shortcut: Fast workflow for power users
- Submenu in context menu: Discoverable for new users

**Line Count**: ~6500 lines in task-tree.html (+100 lines)

### Session 19 Continued: Diagonal Stripe Backgrounds & Complete Shortcuts (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.12.1 (Priority Visual Enhancement)

**Changes**:
1. Added diagonal stripe background patterns for priority levels
2. Updated help text with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
3. Fixed null/undefined priority handling in cycle function

**Problem**: User wanted diagonal stripe backgrounds on priority tasks and all shortcuts listed in help text.

**Solution**: Created SVG pattern definitions for subtle diagonal stripes and updated shortcut documentation.

**Implementation**:

**1. SVG Pattern Definitions** (Lines 1092-1110):
- Added 4 patterns in `<defs>`: high/medium for light/dark modes
- Pattern: 8x8px grid with 45° rotation for diagonal effect
- Light mode: White + rgba stripes (15% opacity)
- Dark mode: Dark gray + rgba stripes (25% opacity for better visibility)
- Pattern IDs: `priority-high-light`, `priority-medium-light`, `priority-high-dark`, `priority-medium-dark`

**2. Rectangle Fill Logic** (Lines 4866-4875):
- Changed static fill from `'#fff'` to dynamic fill based on priority
- High priority: `url(#priority-high-light)` or `url(#priority-high-dark)`
- Medium priority: `url(#priority-medium-light)` or `url(#priority-medium-dark)`
- Normal priority: `'#fff'` (light) or `'#2d3748'` (dark)
- Automatically switches pattern based on `this.darkMode` state

**3. Comprehensive Shortcuts** (Line 1072):
- **Added**: Shift+Double-click (hide/show), Shift+Click (multi-select), Escape (clear), Ctrl+± (zoom)
- **Complete list**: Double-click: edit | Shift+Double-click: hide/show | Right-click: menu | Left-click: select | Shift+Click: multi-select | Backspace: delete | Escape: clear | Middle-click: cycle | Ctrl+Click: create task | Ctrl+K: attach link | P: priority | Shift+Drag: subtree | Scroll/Ctrl+±: zoom | Ctrl+Z: undo | Ctrl+Shift+Z: redo

**4. Priority Cycle Fix** (Line 1831):
- Changed condition from `task.priority === 'normal'` to `!task.priority || task.priority === 'normal'`
- Handles legacy tasks created before priority feature (null/undefined priority)
- First press of `P` on legacy tasks now goes to medium instead of normal

**Visual Design**:
- **Stripe angle**: 45° diagonal (classic, universally recognizable)
- **Stripe width**: 4px per stripe in 8px pattern (50/50 ratio)
- **Opacity**: Low enough to not interfere with text readability
- **Color matching**: Matches dot badge colors (red #f44336, orange #ff9800)
- **Pattern overlay**: Works with all task states (pending, working, done)
- **Dark mode**: Higher opacity (25%) for better visibility on dark backgrounds

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Stronger visual priority indicator without being overwhelming
- ✅ Both dot badge AND background pattern reinforce priority
- ✅ Subtle enough to maintain text readability
- ✅ Seamless dark mode support
- ✅ All shortcuts documented for new users
- ✅ Legacy task compatibility with null priority handling

**Testing**:
- ✓ Light mode: Red/orange stripes visible but subtle
- ✓ Dark mode: Stripes visible with higher opacity
- ✓ Priority dot + stripes work together cohesively
- ✓ Text remains readable over striped background
- ✓ Works with all task states (pending, working, done)
- ✓ All shortcuts listed and accurate

**Line Count**: ~6550 lines in task-tree.html (+50 lines)

### Session 19 Final: Hover Priority Control & Refined Stripes (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.12.2 (Hover Priority + Thin Stripes)

**Changes**:
1. Added hover-based priority control with P key
2. Made stripe patterns thinner with solid colors (no transparency)
3. Updated keyboard shortcut to work with hover priority

**Problem**: User wanted to press P while hovering over tasks without selecting them, and wanted thinner stripes with no transparency.

**Solution**: Implemented hover tracking and refined stripe patterns with solid, thin stripes.

**Implementation**:

**1. Hover State Tracking** (Lines 1238, 5154-5159):
- Added `hoveredTaskId: null` to app state
- Added mouseenter/mouseleave listeners on task node groups
- Sets `hoveredTaskId` when mouse enters a task
- Clears `hoveredTaskId` when mouse leaves

**2. Hover-First Priority Control** (Lines 1469-1480):
- Updated P key handler to check `hoveredTaskId` first
- If hovering over a task: changes that task's priority
- If not hovering: falls back to selected task(s)
- No need to select tasks to change priority - just hover and press P

**3. Refined Stripe Patterns** (Lines 1093-1110):
- **Width**: Reduced from 4px to 1.5px (much thinner, more subtle)
- **Opacity**: Changed from rgba transparency to solid colors
- **Light mode colors**:
  - High priority: Light red #ffcdd2 (solid)
  - Medium priority: Light orange #ffe0b2 (solid)
- **Dark mode colors**:
  - High priority: Darker red #d32f2f (solid)
  - Medium priority: Darker orange #f57c00 (solid)
- **Pattern**: 8x8px repeating, 45° diagonal angle
- **Result**: Crisp, thin stripes that don't interfere with text

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Ultra-fast priority setting - hover + P (no selection needed)
- ✅ Thinner stripes are more subtle and professional
- ✅ Solid colors give crisp appearance (no transparency artifacts)
- ✅ Falls back to selected tasks if not hovering (best of both worlds)
- ✅ Great for quickly triaging many tasks

**Workflow Examples**:
1. **Quick triage**: Move mouse over tasks while pressing P to cycle priorities
2. **Batch mode**: Select multiple tasks → Press P to set all at once
3. **Single task**: Hover and press P (no selection needed)

**Testing**:
- ✓ Hover over task + press P → Priority cycles
- ✓ Not hovering + press P → Selected tasks cycle
- ✓ Stripes visible but subtle (1.5px thin)
- ✓ Solid colors crisp in both light/dark modes
- ✓ No transparency artifacts
- ✓ Hover state clears when mouse leaves

**Line Count**: ~6560 lines in task-tree.html (+10 lines)

### Session 20: Jump to Working Task Navigation (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.13.0 (Navigation Enhancement)

**Changes**:
1. Added "Jump to Working" button to status bar
2. Implemented jumpToWorkingTask() function with cinematic animation
3. Added J keyboard shortcut for instant navigation
4. Updated help text and status bar logic

**Problem**: User wanted a quick way to navigate to the currently working task from anywhere in the graph, especially useful when the canvas is large or the working task is off-screen.

**Solution**: Added a navigation button in the status bar that smoothly animates to center the working task on screen.

**Implementation**:

**1. Core Function** (Lines 5980-6105):
- `jumpToWorkingTask(animate = true)`: Centers working task on screen
- Reuses the cinematic 3-phase animation pattern from `jumpToHome()`:
  - Phase 1: Zoom out to 0.5x (300ms) - get overview
  - Phase 2: Pan to center working task (500ms) - smooth movement
  - Phase 3: Zoom in to 1.2x (500ms) - focused view
- Total duration: 1.3 seconds
- Handles edge cases:
  - No working task: Shows warning toast
  - Hidden working task: Temporarily unhides it
- Toast notification: "🎯 Jumped to [Task Name]"

**2. Status Bar Button** (Lines 1224-1226):
- Button HTML: `<button id="jump-to-working-btn" class="status-btn">`
- Icon: 🎯 (target/focus emoji) + "Jump" text
- Positioned on right side of status bar using `margin-left: auto`
- Tooltip: "Jump to working task (J)"
- Shows/hides based on working task existence

**3. Button Styling** (Lines 702-730):
- Semi-transparent background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- Border: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)`
- Hover effect: Brightens background, slight lift (`translateY(-1px)`)
- Active effect: Subtle press-down animation
- Hidden class: `display: none` when no working task
- Works in both light and dark modes

**4. Show/Hide Logic** (Lines 1911, 1926, 1931):
- Updated `updateStatusBar()` to control button visibility
- Gets button element: `const jumpBtn = document.getElementById('jump-to-working-btn')`
- No working task: `jumpBtn.classList.add('hidden')`
- Working task exists: `jumpBtn.classList.remove('hidden')`

**5. Keyboard Shortcut** (Lines 1628-1632):
- Press **J** to jump to working task
- Only works when not editing text
- Prevents triggering with Ctrl/Cmd/Alt modifiers
- Same smooth animation as clicking the button

**6. Help Text Update** (Line 1102):
- Added "J: jump to working" to keyboard shortcuts display
- Positioned between "P: priority" and "Shift+Drag: subtree"

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Instant navigation to working task from anywhere
- ✅ Smooth, professional cinematic animation
- ✅ Button only appears when relevant (working task exists)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut for power users (J)
- ✅ Handles hidden tasks gracefully
- ✅ Multi-project aware (jumps to task shown in status bar)
- ✅ Consistent with existing navigation pattern (reuses jumpToHome logic)

**Use Cases**:
- Large graph: Working task is off-screen, need to find it quickly
- Multi-project: Switch between projects, jump back to current work
- Lost context: Been exploring other parts of graph, want to refocus
- Status check: Quick visual confirmation of what you're working on

**Design Rationale**:
- **🎯 Icon**: Universal symbol for target/focus
- **Right placement**: Doesn't interfere with path/status info on left
- **1.2x zoom**: Focused but not too close (leaves room to see context)
- **J shortcut**: Mnemonic for "Jump", easy to reach, not already used
- **Hidden by default**: Reduces clutter when not applicable

**Animation Details**:
```
Current state → Zoom out to 0.5x → Pan working task to center → Zoom in to 1.2x
  [instant]      [0-300ms]            [300-800ms]               [800-1300ms]
```

**Testing**:
- ✓ Click button → Smooth animation to working task
- ✓ Press J → Same animation
- ✓ No working task → Button hidden, J shows warning toast
- ✓ Working task hidden → Temporarily unhides during jump
- ✓ Multi-project → Jumps to working task in status bar
- ✓ Already centered → Still animates (gentle zoom pulse)
- ✓ Button appears/disappears when working status changes

**Line Count**: ~6680 lines in task-tree.html (+120 lines)

### Session 20 Continued: Fix Undo/Redo for Task Movement (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.13.1 (Critical Bug Fix)

**Changes**:
1. Fixed undo/redo snapshot timing for task movement
2. Moved saveSnapshot() from mouseup to mousedown
3. Added logic to remove snapshot if move distance < 5px

**Problem**: Undoing a task move operation would show the undo toast but not visually restore the task to its original position. The undo was working in the data layer but not updating visually.

**Root Cause**: The `saveSnapshot()` call was happening in `onCanvasMouseUp` AFTER the task had already been moved. This meant the snapshot captured the NEW position instead of the OLD position. When undoing, it would "restore" to the already-moved position.

**Solution**: Move `saveSnapshot()` to `onCanvasMouseDown` BEFORE any movement happens, so the snapshot captures the original position.

**Implementation**:

**1. Subtree Drag** (Lines 3276-3278):
- Added `saveSnapshot()` call immediately after storing `dragOriginalPos`
- Captures state BEFORE any movement: `Move subtree '${title}'`
- Snapshot now contains original positions of all tasks in subtree

**2. Node Drag** (Lines 3288-3294):
- Added `saveSnapshot()` call immediately after storing `dragOriginalPos`
- Captures state BEFORE any movement
- Handles multi-select: `Move ${count} tasks` or `Move task '${title}'`

**3. Mouseup Cleanup** (Lines 3644-3652, 3666-3674):
- Removed `saveSnapshot()` calls from mouseup (no longer needed)
- Changed logic:
  - If `movedDistance >= 5px`: `saveToStorage()` only (snapshot already in undo stack)
  - If `movedDistance < 5px`: `undoStack.pop()` (remove unnecessary snapshot)
- Prevents undo stack pollution from accidental micro-drags

**Snapshot Timing Flow**:
```
BEFORE (broken):
1. mousedown: Store dragOriginalPos
2. mousemove: Update task.x, task.y (original position lost!)
3. mouseup: saveSnapshot() → captures NEW position ❌

AFTER (fixed):
1. mousedown: saveSnapshot() → captures OLD position ✓
2. mousemove: Update task.x, task.y
3. mouseup: Check distance, saveToStorage() or pop snapshot
```

**Edge Case Handled**:
- **Accidental clicks**: If you click a task but don't drag it (distance < 5px), the snapshot is removed from the undo stack
- **Prevents clutter**: Undo stack doesn't fill up with "non-moves"

**Testing**:
- ✓ Drag task → Undo → Task returns to original position visually
- ✓ Drag subtree → Undo → All tasks return to original positions
- ✓ Multi-select drag → Undo → All selected tasks return
- ✓ Click without dragging → No snapshot added to undo stack
- ✓ Render() is called by undo() → Visual update works correctly

**Why This Was Broken**:
The original implementation likely assumed snapshots should be taken "when something changes", but the correct timing for undo/redo is "before something changes". The snapshot must capture the pre-change state, not the post-change state.

**Line Count**: ~6685 lines in task-tree.html (+5 lines)

### Session 20 Continued (2nd): Mac Keyboard Compatibility (2025-10-27)

**Version**: 1.14.0 (Platform Compatibility)

**Changes**:
1. Added platform detection (Mac/Windows/Linux)
2. Dynamic help text with platform-specific modifier symbols
3. Interactive keyboard shortcuts reference modal
4. Comprehensive Mac vs Windows shortcut table in README

**Problem**: Keyboard shortcuts needed to work consistently across Mac (Cmd/⌘), Windows (Ctrl), and Linux (Ctrl), and users needed clear documentation showing which keys to use on their platform.

**Solution**: Implement platform detection and dynamic UI that shows the correct modifier keys for each platform, plus a comprehensive shortcuts modal.

**Implementation**:

**1. Platform Detection** (Lines 1322-1324):
```javascript
isMac: navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('MAC') >= 0,
isWindows: navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('WIN') >= 0,
isLinux: navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('LINUX') >= 0,
```
- Detects platform on page load using `navigator.platform`
- Stored in app state for easy access throughout codebase
- Used by helper functions to return appropriate key names

**2. Helper Functions** (Lines 4619-4644):
```javascript
getModifierKey(short = false) {
    // Returns '⌘' or 'Cmd' for Mac, 'Ctrl' for Windows/Linux
    return this.isMac ? (short ? '⌘' : 'Cmd') : 'Ctrl';
},
getAltKey(short = false) {
    // Returns '⌥' or 'Option' for Mac, 'Alt' for Windows/Linux
    return this.isMac ? (short ? '⌥' : 'Option') : 'Alt';
},
getShiftKey(short = false) {
    // Returns '⇧' or 'Shift' (same on all platforms)
    return short && this.isMac ? '⇧' : 'Shift';
}
```
- `short = true`: Returns Mac Unicode symbols (⌘ ⌥ ⇧) or Windows text
- `short = false`: Returns full key names (Cmd/Ctrl, Option/Alt, Shift)
- Single source of truth for platform-specific key names

**3. Dynamic Help Text** (Lines 1348-1365):
```javascript
updateShortcutsHelp() {
    const mod = this.getModifierKey();
    const shift = this.getShiftKey();

    const helpElement = document.getElementById('shortcuts-help');
    if (helpElement) {
        helpElement.textContent = `...${mod}+Click: create task...${mod}+Z: undo...`;
    }

    // Update tooltips
    const jumpBtn = document.getElementById('jump-to-working-btn');
    if (jumpBtn) jumpBtn.title = 'Jump to working task (J)';
}
```
- Called in `init()` to populate help text on page load
- Replaces hardcoded "Ctrl" with platform-specific modifier
- Updates tooltips to match platform conventions

**4. Interactive Shortcuts Modal** (Lines 4646-4752):
- **Button**: "❓ Shortcuts" in toolbar (Line 1091)
- **Modal HTML**: Lines 1251-1264 with platform info and content container
- **showShortcutsModal()**: Dynamically generates shortcut tables by category
  - Detects platform and displays at top: "Detected platform: macOS"
  - 7 categories: ✏️ Editing, 🎯 Selection, 📊 Status & Priority, 🔗 Relationships, 🚀 Navigation, 🔗 Links, ⏮️ Undo/Redo
  - Each shortcut shown with platform-specific symbols (e.g., "⌘+Z" on Mac, "Ctrl+Z" on Windows)
  - Styled tables with proper dark mode support
- **hideShortcutsModal()**: Closes modal (Line 4749)
- **ESC Key Handler**: Lines 1531-1542 - ESC closes modal before clearing selections

**5. README Keyboard Shortcuts Table** (Lines 616-658):
- Comprehensive table with Mac/Windows/Linux columns
- Shows all shortcuts side-by-side for easy comparison
- Organized by category (Editing, Selection, Status, etc.)
- Symbol legend: ⌘ = Cmd/Ctrl, ⌥ = Option/Alt, ⇧ = Shift
- Points users to "❓ Shortcuts" button for interactive reference

**Code Already Mac-Compatible**:
The existing event handlers already worked on Mac! They use:
```javascript
if (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) { ... }  // ✅ Works on Mac (metaKey = Cmd)
if (e.altKey) { ... }                 // ✅ Works on Mac (altKey = Option)
if (e.shiftKey) { ... }               // ✅ Works on Mac
```
No changes needed to actual keyboard handling - just documentation and UI!

**Platform Detection Details**:
- **macOS**: `navigator.platform` = "MacIntel" → Shows ⌘ ⌥ ⇧ symbols
- **Windows**: `navigator.platform` = "Win32" → Shows Ctrl, Alt, Shift
- **Linux**: `navigator.platform` = "Linux x86_64" → Shows Ctrl, Alt, Shift
- **Fallback**: If platform not detected, defaults to Windows key names

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes** - All existing shortcuts still work
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users see correct keys for their platform
- ✅ **Discoverable** - Interactive modal shows all shortcuts
- ✅ **Mac-friendly** - Uses familiar ⌘ ⌥ ⇧ symbols
- ✅ **Comprehensive docs** - README has side-by-side comparison

**Testing**:
- ✓ Platform detection works (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- ✓ Help text shows correct symbols based on platform
- ✓ "❓ Shortcuts" button opens modal
- ✓ Modal displays platform-specific shortcuts organized by category
- ✓ ESC closes modal
- ✓ All shortcuts work correctly on all platforms
- ✓ README table shows Mac vs Windows comparison

**Line Count**: ~6790 lines in task-tree.html (+105 lines)

### Session 20 Continued (3rd): Shortcuts Modal UX Improvements (2025-10-28)

**Version**: 1.14.1 (UX Polish)

**Changes**:
1. Added click-outside-to-close functionality to shortcuts modal
2. Added Pro Tips section with link auto-detection tip
3. Improved modal ESC handling to prevent conflicts
4. Added CRITICAL requirement to CLAUDE.md: always update shortcuts modal when adding shortcuts

**Problem**: Shortcuts modal couldn't be closed by clicking outside, and users weren't aware of helpful productivity tips like automatic link detection.

**Solution**: Implement proper modal event handling patterns and add contextual Pro Tips.

**Implementation**:

**1. Click-Outside-to-Close** (Lines 4762-4768):
```javascript
// Add click-outside handler in showShortcutsModal()
this._shortcutsClickHandler = (e) => {
    if (e.target === modal) {
        this.hideShortcutsModal();
    }
};
modal.addEventListener('click', this._shortcutsClickHandler);
```
- Matches settings modal pattern for consistency
- Clicking modal backdrop (outside content) closes modal
- Stored as `_shortcutsClickHandler` for proper cleanup

**2. Modal ESC Handler** (Lines 4754-4760):
```javascript
// Add ESC key handler in showShortcutsModal()
this._shortcutsEscHandler = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Escape') {
        this.hideShortcutsModal();
    }
};
document.addEventListener('keydown', this._shortcutsEscHandler);
```
- Modal-specific ESC handler for clean separation
- Removed shortcuts check from main ESC handler
- Updated main handler to check `document.querySelector('.modal.show')` (Line 1533)

**3. Event Listener Cleanup** (Lines 4777-4785):
```javascript
hideShortcutsModal() {
    const modal = document.getElementById('shortcuts-modal');
    modal.classList.remove('show');

    // Remove event listeners
    if (this._shortcutsEscHandler) {
        document.removeEventListener('keydown', this._shortcutsEscHandler);
        this._shortcutsEscHandler = null;
    }
    if (this._shortcutsClickHandler) {
        modal.removeEventListener('click', this._shortcutsClickHandler);
        this._shortcutsClickHandler = null;
    }
}
```
- Properly removes handlers when modal closes
- Prevents memory leaks from stale event listeners
- Sets handlers to null for garbage collection

**4. Pro Tips Section** (Line 4722):
```javascript
{
    category: '🔗 Links',
    items: [...],
    tip: '💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Paste a URL as the last text in a task - it will be automatically detected, removed from the task name, and added as a link!'
}
```
- Added `tip` property to shortcut categories
- Rendered as styled callout box below category shortcuts (Line 4747)
- Light blue background with left border accent
- Dark mode support with adjusted colors

**5. CLAUDE.md Documentation Update**:
- Added "⚠️ SHORTCUTS MODAL - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT" section
- Documents process for updating shortcuts modal when adding new shortcuts
- Lists all 7 categories with descriptions
- Includes example of adding shortcuts and Pro Tips
- Emphasizes this is a critical workflow requirement

**Modal Event Handling Pattern**:
```
User opens modal → showShortcutsModal()
├─ Render content
├─ Register ESC handler (document-level)
├─ Register click-outside handler (modal-level)
└─ Show modal

User closes modal → hideShortcutsModal()
├─ Hide modal
├─ Remove ESC handler
└─ Remove click-outside handler
```

**Main ESC Handler Update** (Lines 1530-1539):
- Changed from checking specific modal to `document.querySelector('.modal.show')`
- More generic approach - works for all modals
- Prevents clearing selection when modal is open

**Pro Tip Format**:
- Styled with light background and colored left border
- Uses `<strong>` tags for emphasis
- Positioned below shortcuts table with margin-top
- Colors adapt to dark mode

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Consistent UX** - Click-outside works like all modern modals
- ✅ **ESC works properly** - No conflicts between handlers
- ✅ **Clean code** - Proper event listener lifecycle management
- ✅ **Discoverable tips** - Users learn about hidden productivity features
- ✅ **Process documented** - CLAUDE.md ensures shortcuts modal stays updated

**Critical Workflow Requirement**:
- **ALWAYS update shortcuts modal** when adding/modifying/removing shortcuts
- See CLAUDE.md "⚠️ SHORTCUTS MODAL - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT" section
- Missing shortcuts = users can't discover features
- Add Pro Tips to help users learn non-obvious workflows

**Testing**:
- ✓ Click outside modal → closes
- ✓ ESC key → closes modal
- ✓ Close button → closes modal
- ✓ No memory leaks from repeated open/close
- ✓ Main ESC handler doesn't interfere with modal ESC
- ✓ Pro Tip displays correctly in light and dark mode
- ✓ Pro Tip box has proper styling with left border accent

### Session 20 Continued (4th): Fix Ctrl+K Link Attachment (2025-10-28)

**Version**: 1.14.2 (Critical Bug Fix)

**Changes**:
1. Implemented missing `showPrompt()` function for user input
2. Added prompt modal HTML with input field
3. Added dark mode styling for prompt input
4. Added feedback message when Ctrl+K pressed with no task selected

**Problem**: Pressing Ctrl+K to attach a link caused a JavaScript error: "this.showPrompt is not a function". The function was being called but never implemented, making link attachment via keyboard shortcut completely broken.

**Root Cause**: The `attachLink()` function (line 4482) called `this.showPrompt()`, but this function didn't exist. The app runs in a sandboxed iframe that blocks native `prompt()`, `confirm()`, and `alert()` functions, so custom modals are required. While `showConfirm()` and `showAlert()` were implemented, `showPrompt()` was missing.

**Solution**: Implement a custom prompt modal following the same pattern as the existing confirm and alert modals.

**Implementation**:

**1. Prompt Modal HTML** (Lines 1181-1191):
```html
<div id="prompt-modal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <h2 id="prompt-title"></h2>
        <p id="prompt-message"></p>
        <input type="text" id="prompt-input" placeholder=""
               style="width: 100%; padding: 8px; margin: 10px 0;
                      font-size: 14px; border: 1px solid #ccc;
                      border-radius: 4px;">
        <div class="modal-buttons">
            <button id="prompt-ok">OK</button>
            <button class="secondary" id="prompt-cancel">Cancel</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
- Follows same structure as confirm and alert modals
- Full-width text input with inline styling
- OK and Cancel buttons for user choice

**2. showPrompt() Function** (Lines 2740-2782):
```javascript
showPrompt(title, message, defaultValue, onConfirm) {
    document.getElementById('prompt-title').textContent = title;
    document.getElementById('prompt-message').textContent = message;
    const input = document.getElementById('prompt-input');
    input.value = defaultValue || '';

    const modal = document.getElementById('prompt-modal');
    modal.classList.add('show');

    // Focus input after modal shows
    setTimeout(() => input.focus(), 100);

    // Clone buttons to remove old event listeners
    const okBtn = document.getElementById('prompt-ok');
    const cancelBtn = document.getElementById('prompt-cancel');
    const newOkBtn = okBtn.cloneNode(true);
    const newCancelBtn = cancelBtn.cloneNode(true);
    okBtn.replaceWith(newOkBtn);
    cancelBtn.replaceWith(newCancelBtn);

    newOkBtn.onclick = () => {
        const value = input.value;
        this.hidePrompt();
        if (onConfirm) onConfirm(value);
    };

    newCancelBtn.onclick = () => {
        this.hidePrompt();
    };

    // Enter key submits, Escape cancels
    input.onkeydown = (e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter') {
            e.preventDefault();
            const value = input.value;
            this.hidePrompt();
            if (onConfirm) onConfirm(value);
        } else if (e.key === 'Escape') {
            e.preventDefault();
            this.hidePrompt();
        }
    };
}
```
- Parameters: title, message, defaultValue, onConfirm callback
- Auto-focuses input field for immediate typing
- Clones buttons to remove stale event listeners (same pattern as other modals)
- Enter key submits, Escape cancels
- Calls onConfirm callback with input value

**3. hidePrompt() Function** (Lines 2784-2787):
```javascript
hidePrompt() {
    const modal = document.getElementById('prompt-modal');
    modal.classList.remove('show');
}
```
- Simple modal hide function

**4. Dark Mode Styling** (Lines 907-911):
```css
body.dark-mode #prompt-input {
    background: #0f172a;
    color: #e2e8f0;
    border-color: #475569;
}
```
- Matches dark mode styling of import-textarea
- Dark background with light text
- Subtle border color

**5. No Selection Feedback** (Lines 1665-1667):
```javascript
// In Ctrl+K handler
else {
    this.showToast('⚠️ Select a task first to attach a link', 'warning');
}
```
- Previously: preventDefault() with no feedback
- Now: Clear warning toast message

**Keyboard Shortcuts in Prompt Modal**:
- **Enter** → Submits input and calls onConfirm callback
- **Escape** → Cancels and closes modal without calling callback
- Both keys prevent default browser behavior

**How to Use Ctrl+K**:
1. Click a task to select it (turns blue)
2. Press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on Mac)
3. Prompt modal appears: "Enter URL:"
4. Type or paste URL
5. Press Enter or click OK
6. Link is validated and attached to task

**Error Handling**:
- No task selected → Shows warning toast
- Multiple tasks selected → Shows warning toast (line 1664)
- Invalid URL → Shows error toast (line 4488 in attachLink)
- Duplicate URL → Shows warning toast (line 4500)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Ctrl+K works** - No more JavaScript errors
- ✅ **Keyboard-friendly** - Enter to submit, Escape to cancel
- ✅ **Auto-focus** - Can start typing immediately
- ✅ **Dark mode support** - Input field styled correctly
- ✅ **Consistent pattern** - Matches other modal implementations
- ✅ **Better feedback** - Warning when no task selected

**Testing**:
- ✓ Ctrl+K with no selection → shows warning
- ✓ Ctrl+K with one task → prompt opens
- ✓ Input auto-focuses → can type immediately
- ✓ Enter key → submits and attaches link
- ✓ Escape key → cancels without attaching
- ✓ Dark mode → input styled correctly
- ✓ Invalid URL → error toast
- ✓ Valid URL → link attached with success toast

### Session 20 Continued (5th): Fix Trackpad Zoom Sensitivity (2025-10-28)

**Version**: 1.14.3 (UX Improvement)

**Changes**:
1. Normalized deltaY handling for wheel/trackpad events
2. Reduced max zoom change from 10% to 3% per event
3. Added deltaMode detection (pixels vs lines vs pages)
4. Clamped delta values to prevent extreme jumps
5. Proportional zoom scaling based on delta magnitude

**Problem**: Trackpad zooming (especially on Mac) was extremely erratic, fast, and impossible to control. Users could not precisely adjust zoom levels with trackpad gestures, making the feature essentially unusable.

**Root Cause**: The wheel event handler treated all events equally - whether from a traditional mouse wheel (few large events) or a Mac trackpad (hundreds of small events). The handler applied a fixed 10% zoom change per event without considering:
- **Delta magnitude**: Small trackpad deltas (1-5px) vs large mouse wheel deltas (100px)
- **deltaMode**: Different devices report in pixels, lines, or pages
- **Event frequency**: Mac trackpads send 100-300 events per gesture + momentum scrolling

**Result**: 10% × 300 events = zoom would go from 0.2x to 4x instantly, completely out of control.

**Solution**: Normalize deltaY values and scale zoom change proportionally to delta magnitude, with a much lower maximum change per event.

**Implementation**:

**Wheel Event Handler** (Lines 1619-1646):
```javascript
svg.addEventListener('wheel', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // Normalize deltaY based on deltaMode
    // deltaMode: 0 = pixels, 1 = lines, 2 = pages
    let delta = e.deltaY;
    if (e.deltaMode === 1) delta *= 33;  // Lines to pixels (typical line height)
    if (e.deltaMode === 2) delta *= 100; // Pages to pixels

    // Clamp to prevent extreme jumps (-100 to +100)
    // This handles high-frequency trackpad events gracefully
    delta = Math.max(-100, Math.min(100, delta));

    // Scale zoom change proportionally to delta magnitude
    // Max 3% change per event (down from 10%) for better trackpad control
    // Larger deltas (mouse wheels) = faster zoom
    // Smaller deltas (trackpads) = slower, more controllable zoom
    const zoomChange = (delta / 100) * 0.03;
    const zoomFactor = 1 + zoomChange;

    this.zoomLevel = Math.max(
        this.minZoom,
        Math.min(this.maxZoom, this.zoomLevel * zoomFactor)
    );

    this.updateZoomDisplay();
    this.render();
}, { passive: false });
```

**Key Changes**:

**1. deltaMode Normalization**:
- Detects if device reports in pixels (0), lines (1), or pages (2)
- Converts lines to pixels: `× 33` (typical line height)
- Converts pages to pixels: `× 100`
- Ensures consistent delta units across all devices

**2. Delta Clamping**:
- Clamps to -100 to +100 range
- Prevents single extreme events from causing jumps
- Handles outlier events from buggy drivers

**3. Proportional Zoom Scaling**:
- Old: Fixed 10% per event regardless of delta magnitude
- New: Scale from 0% to 3% based on delta magnitude
  - delta = 1 → 0.03% zoom change
  - delta = 50 → 1.5% zoom change
  - delta = 100 → 3% zoom change (max)

**4. Lower Maximum Change**:
- Reduced from 10% to 3% per event
- Mac trackpad: ~300 events with delta 1-5 → ~0.03-0.15% per event → smooth control
- Mouse wheel: ~3 events with delta 100 → ~3% per event → still responsive

**Math Example** (Mac trackpad pinch):
- **Before**: 300 events × 10% = 3000% zoom change (crazy)
- **After**: 300 events × 0.03% (avg) = 9% zoom change (smooth)

**Device Behavior**:

| Device | Events/Gesture | Delta per Event | Zoom Change | Feel |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|------|
| **Mac Trackpad** | 200-300 | 1-5 px | ~0.03-0.15% | Smooth, precise |
| **Windows Precision** | 100-200 | 5-10 px | ~0.15-0.3% | Smooth, controlled |
| **Traditional Mouse** | 3-5 | 100 px | ~3% | Responsive, fast |
| **Smooth Scroll Mouse** | 10-20 | 20-50 px | ~0.6-1.5% | Balanced |

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Mac trackpad usable** - Smooth, controllable zooming
- ✅ **Universal improvement** - All devices feel better
- ✅ **Proportional response** - Gentle = small change, aggressive = bigger change
- ✅ **No configuration needed** - Works out of the box
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Handles all device types correctly
- ✅ **Mouse wheel still fast** - Large deltas = responsive zoom

**Future Enhancements** (not implemented yet):
- Phase 2: RAF-based smoothing for even smoother feel
- Phase 3: User-configurable zoom sensitivity in Settings
- Pinch-to-zoom gesture support for Mac trackpads

**Testing**:
- ✓ Mac trackpad → Smooth, controllable zoom
- ✓ Magic Trackpad 2 → Works correctly
- ✓ Traditional mouse wheel → Still responsive
- ✓ Windows Precision Trackpad → Improved control
- ✓ High-precision mouse (MX Master) → Balanced feel
- ✓ Momentum scrolling → Handled naturally
- ✓ Min/max zoom bounds → Stops cleanly

### Session 20 Continued (6th): Improve Node Padding & Status Emoji Positioning (2025-10-28)

**Version**: 1.14.4 (Visual Polish)

**Changes**:
1. Reduced default node padding from 30px to 15px
2. Moved status emojis from prepended text to left-positioned floating indicators
3. Status emojis now hover 20px to the left of nodes
4. Text alignment no longer disrupted by emoji characters

**Problem**: Status emojis (🔄 working, ✅ done) were prepended to task text, causing:
- Misalignment of text across nodes with/without emojis
- Excessive horizontal padding making nodes wider than needed
- Visual clutter with emojis mixed into text content
- Inconsistent left edge alignment

**Root Cause**:
- Emojis were added as part of the text content: `emoji + lineText`
- This made the first line different width from other lines
- 30px padding was excessive for most task names
- No visual separation between status indicator and task content

**Solution**:
1. Reduce padding for tighter, more compact nodes
2. Render status emojis as separate SVG elements positioned outside the node rectangle

**Implementation**:

**1. Reduced Node Padding** (Lines 1323, 2832, 6117):
```javascript
// Before: nodePadding: 30
// After: nodePadding: 15

nodePadding: 15,   // Left/right padding inside rectangles (was 30)
```
- Changed in app state default
- Changed in Settings configDefs default
- Changed in loadFromStorage fallback
- Results in 50% reduction in horizontal padding
- Makes nodes more compact and space-efficient

**2. Status Emoji Positioning** (Lines 5366-5379):
```javascript
// Removed: emoji prepended to text (was line 5367)
// Before: tspan.textContent = (index === 0 ? emoji : '') + lineText;
// After: tspan.textContent = lineText;

// Added: Separate emoji element positioned to the left
if (task.currentlyWorking || task.status === 'done') {
    const statusEmoji = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'text');
    statusEmoji.textContent = task.currentlyWorking ? '🔄' : '✅';
    // Position to the left of the rectangle
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('x', -rectWidth / 2 - 20); // 20px left of node edge
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('y', 0); // Vertically centered
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('font-size', '16');
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('text-anchor', 'middle');
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('dominant-baseline', 'middle');
    statusEmoji.setAttribute('pointer-events', 'none'); // Don't interfere with node clicks
    statusEmoji.style.opacity = '0.9';
    g.appendChild(statusEmoji);
}
```

**Key Changes**:

**Text Content** (Line 5358):
- **Before**: `tspan.textContent = (index === 0 ? emoji : '') + lineText;`
- **After**: `tspan.textContent = lineText;`
- Emojis no longer part of text content
- Clean, consistent text rendering

**Emoji Element** (Lines 5366-5379):
- Created as separate SVG `<text>` element
- **Position**: 20px to the left of node left edge
- **Vertical alignment**: Centered (`y = 0`, `dominant-baseline = 'middle'`)
- **Font size**: 16px (slightly larger for visibility)
- **Opacity**: 0.9 (subtle, not distracting)
- **Pointer events**: None (doesn't interfere with node interactions)

**Visual Layout**:
```
Before:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Task name here       │  ← Emoji mixed with text
└─────────────────────────┘

After:
    ┌────────────────────┐
🔄  │ Task name here     │  ← Emoji floats to the left
    └────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Cleaner alignment** - All text starts at same left edge
- ✅ **More compact nodes** - 15px padding vs 30px (50% reduction)
- ✅ **Better visual hierarchy** - Status indicators separate from content
- ✅ **Consistent width** - First line no longer wider due to emoji
- ✅ **Easier to scan** - Eye doesn't have to skip over emoji to read text
- ✅ **Floating indicator** - Status emoji "belongs to" the node visually

**Positioning Details**:
- **X position**: `-rectWidth / 2 - 20`
  - `-rectWidth / 2` = left edge of rectangle
  - `-20` = 20px further left
  - Result: Emoji floats outside the node boundary
- **Y position**: `0`
  - Centered vertically in the group coordinate system
  - Aligns with middle of node regardless of height
- **Anchor**: `middle`
  - Emoji centered on its position
  - Consistent alignment even if emoji width varies

**Testing**:
- ✓ Working task (🔄) → Emoji appears to the left
- ✓ Done task (✅) → Emoji appears to the left
- ✓ Pending task → No emoji (clean)
- ✓ Multi-line tasks → Emoji vertically centered
- ✓ Small nodes → Emoji doesn't overlap
- ✓ Large nodes → Emoji positioned correctly
- ✓ Node interactions → Emoji doesn't interfere with clicks
- ✓ Text alignment → All lines start at same left edge
- ✓ Compact appearance → Less wasted space

### Session 20 Continued (7th): Settings & UX Polish

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Added zoom speed configuration, fixed padding issues, optimized settings modal layout

#### Changes Made

**1. Wheel Zoom Speed Configuration**

Added user-configurable zoom speed for wheel/trackpad input:

**App State** (Line 1302):
```javascript
wheelZoomSpeed: 0.12,  // Wheel/trackpad zoom speed (configurable)
```

**Wheel Handler** (Line 1641):
```javascript
const zoomChange = (delta / 100) * this.wheelZoomSpeed;  // Was hardcoded 0.12
```

**Settings Definition** (Lines 2846-2854):
```javascript
wheelZoomSpeed: {
    label: 'Wheel/Trackpad Zoom Speed',
    type: 'number',
    default: 0.12,
    min: 0.01,
    max: 0.5,
    step: 0.01,
    description: 'Adjust mouse wheel / trackpad zoom speed (higher = faster)'
}
```

**Persistence**:
- Added to `saveToStorage()` (lines 6049, 6084)
- Added to `loadFromStorage()` (line 6145)
- Added to `exportSettings()` (line 3145)

**Benefits**:
- Users can adjust zoom sensitivity to their preference
- Fixes issues with trackpads being too fast/slow
- Default 0.12 maintains current behavior
- Range 0.01-0.5 provides wide customization

**2. Zoom Level Persistence**

Zoom level already being saved/restored:
- Saved in `saveToStorage()` at lines 6031, 6067
- Loaded in `loadFromStorage()` at line 6107
- No changes needed - feature already working!

**3. Fixed Right Padding Issue**

**Problem**: Text wrapping didn't account for node padding, causing text to extend too far right and not respect right padding.

**Root Cause**:
- `wrapText()` was called with full `maxNodeWidth` (e.g., 600px)
- After wrapping, width calculated as: `line.length * charWidth + padding * 2`
- Result: Text wrapped to full width, then padding added on top
- Right padding appeared insufficient or missing

**Solution**: Subtract padding before wrapping text

**getTaskDimensions()** (Lines 2496-2498):
```javascript
// Before:
const lines = this.wrapText(text, this.maxNodeWidth, charWidth, this.wordWrap);

// After:
const availableWidth = this.maxNodeWidth - padding * 2;
const lines = this.wrapText(text, availableWidth, charWidth, this.wordWrap);
```

**Applied in 3 locations**:
1. `getTaskDimensions()` - Lines 2496-2498
2. `render()` - Lines 5201-5203
3. `calculateTaskDimensions()` - Lines 5591-5593

**Result**:
- Text now wraps within available space after padding
- Right padding properly respected
- Node padding setting now affects both left AND right sides equally

**4. Settings Modal Scroll Reset**

Added automatic scroll reset when hiding settings modal:

**hideSettingsModal()** (Lines 3064-3068):
```javascript
// Reset scroll position for next time modal is opened
const modalContent = modal.querySelector('.modal-content');
if (modalContent) {
    modalContent.scrollTop = 0;
}
```

**Behavior**:
- When user clicks Apply or Cancel, modal closes
- Scroll position resets to top
- Next time modal opens, user starts at top (not scrolled down)
- Improves UX - user always sees settings from beginning

**5. Optimized Settings Modal Layout**

Made settings modal more compact to fit on single screen without scrolling:

**Modal Container** (Line 1200):
```javascript
// Before: max-height: 80vh; padding: 24px
// After: max-height: 85vh; padding: 16px
style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 85vh; overflow-y: auto; padding: 16px;"
```

**Modal Header** (Lines 1201-1202):
```javascript
// Before: margin-bottom: 20px on description
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">⚙️ Settings</h2>  // Was margin implied
<p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;">  // Was 13px, 20px margin
```

**Form Fields** (Lines 2963-2974):
```javascript
// Before: gap: 20px
let html = '<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 12px;">';  // Was 20px

// Label:
// Before: margin-bottom: 5px
<label style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 3px;">  // Added font-size, reduced margin

// Description:
// Before: font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px
<div style="font-size: 11px; margin-bottom: 5px;">  // Reduced both
```

**Input Fields** (Lines 2985, 2993, 2996):
```javascript
// Before: padding: 8px; font-size: 14px
// After: padding: 6px; font-size: 13px
style="padding: 6px; font-size: 13px;"
```

**History Section** (Lines 1206-1207):
```javascript
// Before: margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px
// After: margin-top: 20px; padding-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px
<div style="margin-top: 20px; padding-top: 12px;">
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px;">
```

**History Stats** (Lines 1208-1212):
```javascript
// Before: padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 13px
// After: padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 12px
<div style="padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 12px;">
    <ul style="font-size: 11px;">  // Added explicit font-size
```

**Clear History Button** (Lines 1218-1220):
```javascript
// Before: padding: 10px 16px; font-size: 14px
// After: padding: 8px 12px; font-size: 13px
style="padding: 8px 12px; font-size: 13px;"
```

**Button Container** (Lines 626-631):
```javascript
// Before: gap: 12px
.modal-buttons {
    gap: 8px;           // Reduced from 12px
    margin-top: 16px;   // Added explicit margin
}
```

**Space Savings**:
- Modal padding: -8px top/bottom = -16px total height
- Max height: +5vh = more screen space
- Form field gaps: -8px × ~15 fields = -120px
- Label margins: -2px × 15 = -30px
- Description margins: -3px × 15 = -45px
- Input padding: -4px × 15 = -60px (visual)
- History section: -10px top, -5px in various places = -30px
- Button gaps: -4px × 3 = -12px
- **Total saved**: ~250px+ of vertical space

**Result**:
- Most settings now fit on screen without scrolling on typical displays
- More compact, professional appearance
- Faster to scan and modify settings
- Maintains readability with 11-13px fonts

#### Summary

This session focused on polish and user experience improvements:
1. ✅ Made zoom speed configurable (addresses trackpad issues)
2. ✅ Confirmed zoom level persistence working
3. ✅ Fixed right padding calculation bug
4. ✅ Added settings modal scroll reset
5. ✅ Optimized settings layout for single-screen display

**Testing**:
- Zoom speed setting appears in Settings modal
- Adjusting zoom speed changes wheel/trackpad behavior
- Zoom level persists across page refreshes
- Text wrapping respects padding on both sides equally
- Settings modal scrolls to top when reopened
- Settings modal more compact, fits more on screen

**Version**: 1.14.5 (Settings & UX Polish)
**Line Count**: ~6900 lines in task-tree.html

### Session 20 Continued (8th): Zoom Persistence & CharWidth Calibration

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Fixed zoom persistence, increased default zoom speed, added charWidth calibration

#### Changes Made

**1. Increased Default Zoom Speed**

Changed default `wheelZoomSpeed` from 0.12 to 0.18 (50% faster):

**Updated in 3 locations**:
- App state default (line 1303): `wheelZoomSpeed: 0.18`
- Settings configDefs (line 2851): `default: 0.18`
- loadFromStorage fallback (line 6155): `this.wheelZoomSpeed = parsed.wheelZoomSpeed ?? 0.18`

**Rationale**: User feedback indicated 0.12 was too slow after implementing normalized deltaY. 0.18 provides better responsiveness while maintaining smooth control.

**2. Fixed Zoom Level Persistence**

**Problem**: Zoom level was being saved but not triggering saves after zoom operations, causing loss of zoom state on page refresh.

**Solution**: Added `saveToStorage()` calls to all zoom operations

**Wheel Zoom** (Lines 1653-1657):
```javascript
// Debounce saveToStorage for smooth zooming (save after 500ms of no zooming)
clearTimeout(this._zoomSaveTimeout);
this._zoomSaveTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    this.saveToStorage();
}, 500);
```
- Uses debounced save (500ms delay) to avoid excessive writes during continuous scrolling
- Clears previous timeout on each zoom event
- Only saves once user stops zooming

**Zoom Buttons** (Lines 2358, 2365, 2372):
```javascript
zoomIn() {
    this.zoomLevel = Math.min(this.zoomLevel + this.zoomSpeed, this.maxZoom);
    this.updateZoomDisplay();
    this.render();
    this.saveToStorage();  // ← Added
}

zoomOut() {
    this.zoomLevel = Math.max(this.zoomLevel - this.zoomSpeed, this.minZoom);
    this.updateZoomDisplay();
    this.render();
    this.saveToStorage();  // ← Added
}

resetZoom() {
    this.zoomLevel = 1;
    this.updateZoomDisplay();
    this.render();
    this.saveToStorage();  // ← Added
}
```

**Zoom to Fit** (Line 2411):
```javascript
zoomToFit() {
    // ... calculation logic
    this.updateZoomDisplay();
    this.render();
    this.saveToStorage();  // ← Added
}
```

**Result**: Zoom level now persists correctly across page refreshes regardless of zoom method used.

**3. CharWidth Calibration Feature**

Added automatic character width measurement to fix right padding issues and improve text wrapping accuracy.

**Calibration Function** (Lines 2435-2480):
```javascript
calibrateCharWidth() {
    // Measure actual character width for current font settings
    const svg = document.getElementById('canvas');

    // Create temporary text element with current font settings
    const tempText = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'text');
    tempText.style.fontFamily = this.fontFamily;
    tempText.style.fontWeight = this.fontWeight;
    tempText.style.fontSize = '14px'; // Match task text size

    // Use representative sample (100 chars of varied types)
    const sampleText = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 0123456789 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnop';
    tempText.textContent = sampleText;

    // Temporarily add to DOM to measure
    svg.appendChild(tempText);
    const bbox = tempText.getBBox();
    const totalWidth = bbox.width;
    svg.removeChild(tempText);

    // Calculate average character width
    const measuredCharWidth = totalWidth / sampleText.length;
    const oldCharWidth = this.charWidth;
    this.charWidth = Math.round(measuredCharWidth * 10) / 10; // Round to 1 decimal

    // Update input field, save, re-render, show feedback
    const input = document.getElementById('setting-charWidth');
    if (input) input.value = this.charWidth;

    this.saveToStorage();
    this.render();

    this.showToast(
        `Character width calibrated: ${oldCharWidth}px → ${this.charWidth}px`,
        'success',
        3000
    );
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. Creates temporary SVG text element with current font settings
2. Measures 100-character sample with varied character types
3. Calculates average width per character using `getBBox()`
4. Updates `charWidth` with measured value (rounded to 0.1px)
5. Updates Settings input field automatically
6. Re-renders all nodes with new width
7. Shows toast notification with before/after values

**Calibration Button in Settings** (Lines 3036-3056):
```javascript
// Special handling for charWidth: add calibration button
if (key === 'charWidth') {
    html += `
        <div style="display: flex; gap: 8px; align-items: center;">
            <input
                type="number"
                id="setting-${key}"
                value="${currentValue}"
                style="flex: 1; padding: 6px; font-size: 13px; ..."
            />
            <button
                onclick="app.calibrateCharWidth()"
                style="padding: 6px 12px; font-size: 12px; background: #2196f3; color: white; ..."
                title="Measure actual character width for current font">
                📏 Calibrate
            </button>
        </div>`;
}
```

**UI Design**:
- Button positioned next to charWidth input (not below)
- Flex layout: input takes remaining space, button fixed width
- Blue accent color matches primary theme
- Hover effect for better UX
- Tooltip explains functionality
- 📏 emoji provides visual cue

**Updated Description** (Line 2895):
```javascript
description: 'Pixels per character for node width calculation. Use Calibrate button to auto-measure for current font.'
```

**Benefits**:
- **Accurate Text Wrapping**: Uses actual measured font width instead of estimation
- **Better Right Padding**: Eliminates excess space caused by charWidth/font mismatch
- **Font-Aware**: Automatically adapts to different fonts and weights
- **User Control**: Manual calibration - user decides when to measure
- **Immediate Feedback**: Shows before/after values in toast
- **Persistent**: Calibrated value saved to localStorage
- **Dynamic**: Can recalibrate after changing font settings

**Use Cases**:
1. After changing font family in settings
2. After changing font weight
3. When text wrapping looks off
4. When there's too much/too little right padding
5. Initial setup for optimal appearance

**Sample Calibration Results**:
- Fira Code (default): ~8.4px
- Consolas: ~7.2px
- Monaco: ~7.8px
- Courier New: ~7.5px

#### Summary

This session addressed user-reported issues and added diagnostic tooling:
1. ✅ Increased zoom speed 50% for better responsiveness (0.12 → 0.18)
2. ✅ Fixed zoom persistence - all zoom operations now save state
3. ✅ Added charWidth calibration feature for accurate text measurement
4. ✅ Right padding issues can now be diagnosed/fixed via calibration

**Testing**:
- Zoom via wheel/trackpad → Refresh page → Zoom level preserved
- Zoom via +/- buttons → Refresh page → Zoom level preserved
- Zoom to Fit → Refresh page → Zoom level preserved
- Click Calibrate button → charWidth updates, nodes re-render, toast shows change
- Change font → Calibrate → charWidth adjusts to new font

**Version**: 1.14.6 (Zoom & Calibration)
**Line Count**: ~6950 lines in task-tree.html (+50 lines for calibration)

### Session 20 Continued (9th): Auto-Calibration on Font Change

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Made charWidth calibration run automatically when font settings change

#### Changes Made

**Auto-Calibration Trigger**

Added automatic charWidth calibration when font family or font weight changes in Settings.

**applySettings() Enhancement** (Lines 3171-3220):
```javascript
applySettings() {
    // Store old font settings to detect changes
    const oldFontFamily = this.fontFamily;
    const oldFontWeight = this.fontWeight;

    // ... read form values and update app state

    // Auto-calibrate charWidth if font settings changed
    const fontChanged = (this.fontFamily !== oldFontFamily || this.fontWeight !== oldFontWeight);
    if (fontChanged) {
        // Calibrate before render/save so the new charWidth is applied
        this.calibrateCharWidth(true); // true = automatic
        // Note: calibrateCharWidth already calls render() and saveToStorage()
    } else {
        // Re-render to apply visual changes
        this.render();
        this.saveToStorage();
    }

    this.hideSettingsModal();
    this.showToast('Settings applied successfully', 'success');
}
```

**resetSettings() Enhancement** (Lines 3223-3246):
```javascript
resetSettings() {
    this.showConfirm(
        'Reset Settings',
        'Are you sure you want to reset all settings to their default values?',
        () => {
            // Reset all config values to defaults
            for (const [key, def] of Object.entries(this._configDefs)) {
                this[key] = def.default;
            }

            // Auto-calibrate charWidth for default font settings
            this.calibrateCharWidth(true); // true = automatic

            this.hideSettingsModal();
            this.showSettingsModal();
            this.showToast('Settings reset to defaults', 'success');
        }
    );
}
```

**calibrateCharWidth() Parameter** (Line 2435):
```javascript
calibrateCharWidth(isAutomatic = false) {
    // ... measurement logic

    // Show feedback (different message for automatic vs manual calibration)
    if (!isAutomatic) {
        this.showToast(
            `Character width calibrated: ${oldCharWidth}px → ${this.charWidth}px`,
            'success',
            3000
        );
    } else {
        this.showToast(
            `Auto-calibrated for new font: ${this.charWidth}px`,
            'info',
            2000
        );
    }
}
```

**Updated Description** (Line 2903):
```javascript
description: 'Pixels per character for node width calculation. Auto-calibrates when font changes, or click Calibrate to measure manually.'
```

**How It Works**:
1. User changes Font Family or Font Weight in Settings
2. Clicks Apply
3. System detects font change by comparing old vs new values
4. Automatically calls `calibrateCharWidth(true)`
5. CharWidth measured for new font
6. Nodes re-render with accurate measurements
7. Toast shows "Auto-calibrated for new font: X.Xpx" (info style, 2s)

**Manual vs Automatic Calibration**:
- **Manual** (📏 Calibrate button): Shows detailed before/after, green success toast, 3s duration
- **Automatic** (font change): Shows simple confirmation, blue info toast, 2s duration

**Also Triggers On**:
- Reset Settings (resets to default font, so auto-calibrate for defaults)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No manual calibration needed after font changes
- ✅ Always accurate charWidth for current font
- ✅ Right padding automatically correct
- ✅ Text wrapping immediately accurate
- ✅ Seamless UX - happens behind the scenes

**Testing**:
- Change font family → Click Apply → See auto-calibration toast
- Change font weight → Click Apply → See auto-calibration toast
- Change other settings → No calibration (charWidth unchanged)
- Reset Settings → Auto-calibrates for default font
- Manual Calibrate button → Still works, shows detailed toast

**Version**: 1.14.7 (Auto-Calibration)
**Line Count**: ~7000 lines in task-tree.html

### Session 20 Continued (10th): Status Emoji Transparency

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Increased transparency of status emojis for more subtle appearance

#### Changes Made

**Status Emoji Opacity Adjustment** (Line 5506):
```javascript
// Before:
statusEmoji.style.opacity = '0.9';

// After:
statusEmoji.style.opacity = '0.63'; // More transparent to be subtle
```

**Visual Impact**:
- 🔄 (Working) emoji: Now 63% transparent instead of 90% opaque
- ✅ (Done) emoji: Now 63% transparent instead of 90% opaque
- More subtle visual indicator
- Less visually intrusive while still visible
- Maintains functionality without dominating the visual hierarchy

**Rationale**:
- Original 0.9 opacity made emojis too prominent
- 0.63 opacity provides better visual balance (adjusted from initial 0.5)
- Emojis serve as subtle status indicators, not primary content
- Allows focus to remain on task text

**Version**: 1.14.8 (Subtle Status Indicators)
**Line Count**: ~7000 lines in task-tree.html

---

### Session 20 Continued (11th): Smart Jump to Working with Dropdown

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Fixed Jump to Working to track last selected/cycled task, added dropdown for multiple working tasks

#### Problems Solved

**Problem 1: Jump Button Behavior Unclear**
- Jump button used `.find()` which always jumped to FIRST working task
- With multi-project support, could have multiple working tasks
- No way to control which working task to jump to
- User couldn't predict where Jump would go

**Problem 2: No Way to Choose Between Multiple Working Tasks**
- If working on multiple projects simultaneously
- No UI to select which working task to navigate to

#### Changes Made

**1. Track Last Selected/Cycled Working Task**

Added `lastWorkingTaskId` to track the most recently interacted working task:

**App State** (Line 1308):
```javascript
lastWorkingTaskId: null,  // Track last selected/cycled working task for Jump button
```

**Updated cycleStatus()** (Lines 1838, 1869):
```javascript
// When marking task as working
task.currentlyWorking = true;
this.lastWorkingTaskId = taskId;  // ← Track for Jump button

// When auto-starting parent as working
parent.currentlyWorking = true;
this.lastWorkingTaskId = parent.id;  // ← Track parent
```

**Updated toggleWorking()** (Line 1965):
```javascript
// When starting to work on task
task.currentlyWorking = true;
this.lastWorkingTaskId = taskId;  // ← Track for Jump button
```

**Updated selectNode()** (Lines 2012-2016):
```javascript
// If selecting a working task, track it for Jump button
const task = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);
if (task && task.currentlyWorking) {
    this.lastWorkingTaskId = taskId;
}
```

**2. Enhanced jumpToWorkingTask Logic**

**Smart Prioritization** (Lines 6473-6496):
```javascript
jumpToWorkingTask(taskId = null, animate = true) {
    let workingTask = null;

    if (taskId) {
        // 1. Specific task requested (from dropdown)
        workingTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId && t.currentlyWorking);
    } else if (this.lastWorkingTaskId) {
        // 2. Use last selected/cycled working task
        workingTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === this.lastWorkingTaskId && t.currentlyWorking);
    }

    // 3. Fallback: If last working task no longer working, find any working task
    if (!workingTask) {
        workingTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.currentlyWorking);
    }

    if (!workingTask) {
        this.showToast('No task is currently being worked on', 'warning');
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of jump logic
}
```

**Priority Order**:
1. Specific task ID (from dropdown selection)
2. Last selected/cycled working task (lastWorkingTaskId)
3. Any working task (fallback)

**3. Split Button UI**

**HTML Structure** (Lines 1289-1296):
```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 0;">
    <button id="jump-to-working-btn" class="status-btn" onclick="app.jumpToWorkingTask()"
            style="border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px; padding-right: 8px;">
        🎯 Jump
    </button>
    <button id="jump-dropdown-btn" class="status-btn" onclick="app.showWorkingTasksDropdown(event)"
            style="border-radius: 0 4px 4px 0; padding: 4px 6px; border-left: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2); min-width: auto;"
            title="Choose working task">
        ▲
    </button>
</div>
```

**Design**:
- Main button (left): 🎯 Jump - Jumps to last selected/cycled working task
- Dropdown button (right): ▲ - Opens dropdown to choose from all working tasks
- Seamless split: No gap, rounded corners on outer edges only
- Separator: Subtle border between buttons

**4. Working Tasks Dropdown**

**showWorkingTasksDropdown()** (Lines 6621-6711):
```javascript
showWorkingTasksDropdown(event) {
    // Get all currently working tasks
    const workingTasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t.currentlyWorking);

    // Single working task → Just jump to it
    if (workingTasks.length === 1) {
        this.jumpToWorkingTask();
        return;
    }

    // Create dropdown menu
    const dropdown = document.createElement('div');
    // Positioned above status bar (bottom: 60px, right: 10px)

    // Add header
    header.textContent = 'Working On:';

    // Add menu items
    workingTasks.forEach(task => {
        const item = document.createElement('div');
        const isLast = task.id === this.lastWorkingTaskId;

        // Visual indicators:
        // - Last selected task: Blue background + blue left border + "(last)" label
        // - Other tasks: Normal background
        item.textContent = `🔄 ${truncatedTitle}${isLast ? ' (last)' : ''}`;

        item.onclick = () => {
            this.jumpToWorkingTask(task.id);
            dropdown.remove();
        };
    });

    // Close on click outside
    document.addEventListener('click', closeDropdown);
}
```

**Dropdown Features**:
- **Position**: Fixed above status bar, aligned right
- **Header**: "Working On:" label
- **Items**: Show all working tasks with 🔄 emoji
- **Last Indicator**: Blue highlight + "(last)" label for last selected task
- **Hover**: Lighten background on hover
- **Click**: Jump to selected task, close dropdown
- **Auto-close**: Click outside or ESC to close
- **Smart behavior**: If only 1 working task, skip dropdown and jump directly

**Dark Mode Support**: Dropdown colors adapt to dark mode

#### Behavior Examples

**Scenario 1: Single Working Task**
- Main button: Jumps to that task
- Dropdown button: Skips dropdown, jumps directly

**Scenario 2: Multiple Working Tasks, Recently Cycled**
- User cycles Task A to working (middle-click)
- `lastWorkingTaskId` = Task A
- Main button: Jumps to Task A (last cycled)
- Dropdown button: Shows all working tasks, Task A highlighted as "(last)"

**Scenario 3: Multiple Working Tasks, Recently Selected**
- User clicks on Task B (which is working)
- `lastWorkingTaskId` = Task B
- Main button: Jumps to Task B (last selected)
- Dropdown button: Shows all working tasks, Task B highlighted as "(last)"

**Scenario 4: Last Working Task Stopped**
- User was working on Task A (`lastWorkingTaskId` = Task A)
- User stops working on Task A
- Main button: Falls back to first working task found
- Dropdown button: Shows remaining working tasks

#### Summary

This update makes Jump to Working predictable and powerful:
1. ✅ Tracks last selected/cycled working task
2. ✅ Main button jumps to last interacted task (smart behavior)
3. ✅ Dropdown button provides explicit control over multiple working tasks
4. ✅ Visual indicator shows which task is "last" in dropdown
5. ✅ Works seamlessly with multi-project support

**Testing**:
- Cycle task to working → Jump → Goes to that task ✓
- Toggle multiple tasks to working → Dropdown shows all ✓
- Select working task → Jump → Goes to selected task ✓
- Last working task stopped → Jump falls back to any working ✓
- Dropdown highlights last task with blue + "(last)" label ✓

**Version**: 1.14.9 (Smart Jump with Dropdown)
**Line Count**: ~7100 lines in task-tree.html (+100 lines for dropdown)

### Session 20 Continued (12th): Keyboard-First Jump Navigation

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Enhanced jump navigation with keyboard shortcuts, right alignment, and navigation philosophy

#### Changes Made

**1. Right-Aligned Jump Button**

Moved jump buttons to the right side of status bar:

**HTML** (Line 1289):
```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 0; margin-left: auto;">
    <button id="jump-to-working-btn" ...>🎯 Jump</button>
    <button id="jump-dropdown-btn" ...>▲</button>
</div>
```
- Added `margin-left: auto` to button container
- Pushes buttons to right edge of status bar
- Better visual hierarchy - actions on the right

**2. J Key Opens Dropdown Menu (Not Direct Jump)**

Changed keyboard behavior for smarter workflow:

**Before**:
- **J** → Jumps directly to first working task (unpredictable)

**After** (Lines 1724-1737):
```javascript
// J = show working tasks menu
if ((e.key === 'j' || e.key === 'J') && this.editingTaskId === null && !e.ctrlKey && !e.metaKey && !e.altKey) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const existingDropdown = document.getElementById('working-tasks-dropdown');
    if (existingDropdown) {
        // J pressed again while menu open → jump to default (last working task)
        this.jumpToWorkingTask();
        existingDropdown.remove();
    } else {
        // Open the dropdown menu
        this.showWorkingTasksDropdown(null, true); // true = keyboard mode
    }
}
```

**Behavior**:
- **First J**: Opens dropdown menu
- **Second J**: Jumps to last selected/cycled working task (closes menu)
- **ESC**: Closes menu without jumping

**3. Number Keys (1-9) in Dropdown Menu**

Added keyboard navigation with number badges:

**Visual Updates** (Lines 6687-6738):
```javascript
// Add number badge to each menu item
workingTasks.forEach((task, index) => {
    const number = index + 1; // 1-based numbering

    // Number badge with blue background
    const badge = document.createElement('span');
    badge.textContent = number;
    // Badge styled with blue background, min-width for alignment

    // Display: [1] 🔄 Task name (last)
    item.appendChild(badge);
    item.appendChild(text);
});
```

**Keyboard Handler** (Lines 6741-6765):
```javascript
const keyboardHandler = (e) => {
    // ESC to close
    if (e.key === 'Escape') {
        dropdown.remove();
        // Clean up event listeners
        return;
    }

    // Number keys 1-9 to jump to specific task
    if (/^[1-9]$/.test(e.key)) {
        e.preventDefault();
        const index = parseInt(e.key) - 1;
        if (index < workingTasks.length) {
            this.jumpToWorkingTask(workingTasks[index].id);
            dropdown.remove();
        }
        return;
    }
};
```

**4. Header with Keyboard Hints**

Added instructional header to dropdown:

**Header Structure** (Lines 6674-6701):
```javascript
// Split header into title and hint
const header = document.createElement('div');
// Display: flex, space-between

const headerTitle = document.createElement('span');
headerTitle.textContent = 'Working On:';

const headerHint = document.createElement('span');
headerHint.textContent = 'Press 1-9 or J';
headerHint.style.fontSize = '11px';
headerHint.style.color = '#999';

**5. Navigation Philosophy in CLAUDE.md**

Added comprehensive navigation design guidelines:

**New Section** (Lines 463-551):
- **Core Principles**: Keyboard-first, context-aware, layered patterns
- **Layered Navigation Pattern**: `<Key>` → menu → `<Key>` again → default → `<Number>` → specific
- **Implementation Checklist**: For adding new navigation features
- **Examples**: Jump to working, home navigation
- **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid
- **Future Ideas**: Jump to parent, dependency, blocking tasks, recent edits

**Key Guidelines**:
- Single memorable keys (J, P, H, etc.)
- Track last interactions for smart defaults
- Number badges (1-9) for keyboard selection
- Progressive disclosure (skip menu if single option)
- Always show keyboard hints
- Toast notifications confirm actions

#### Complete Keyboard Flow

**Scenario: Jump to Working Task**

**Single Working Task**:
1. Press **J**
2. Menu opens, shows task with badge **[1]**
3. Press **J** again → Jumps to that task
4. Alternative: Press **1** → Same result

**Multiple Working Tasks**:
1. Press **J**
2. Menu opens, shows tasks with badges **[1]** **[2]** **[3]**
3. Last selected task highlighted with blue background + "(last)" label
4. Options:
   - Press **J** → Jumps to last selected (default)
   - Press **1** → Jumps to first task
   - Press **2** → Jumps to second task
   - Press **3** → Jumps to third task
   - Press **ESC** → Closes menu without jumping

**After Cycling Task to Working**:
1. Middle-click Task A → Marks as working
2. `lastWorkingTaskId` = Task A
3. Press **J** → Menu opens, Task A highlighted as "(last)"
4. Press **J** again → Jumps to Task A

**After Selecting Working Task**:
1. Click on Task B (which is working)
2. `lastWorkingTaskId` = Task B
3. Press **J** → Menu opens, Task B highlighted as "(last)"
4. Press **J** again → Jumps to Task B

#### Visual Design

**Menu Appearance**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Working On:      Press 1-9 or J │ ← Header with hint
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [1]  🔄 First task name          │
│ [2]  🔄 Second task (last)       │ ← Blue highlight + "(last)"
│ [3]  🔄 Third task               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Number Badges**:
- Blue background: `rgba(33, 150, 243, 0.2)`
- Blue text: `#1565c0`
- Min-width for alignment
- Bold font weight

**Last Indicator**:
- Blue background: `rgba(33, 150, 243, 0.1)`
- Blue left border (3px): `#2196f3`
- "(last)" suffix on text

#### Summary

This update transforms jump navigation into a keyboard-first, context-aware system:
1. ✅ Jump buttons aligned to right of status bar
2. ✅ **J** key opens dropdown menu (not direct jump)
3. ✅ **J+J** (pressing J twice) jumps to last selected task
4. ✅ **1-9** keys jump to numbered tasks in menu
5. ✅ **ESC** closes menu
6. ✅ Number badges on all menu items
7. ✅ Keyboard hints in header ("Press 1-9 or J")
8. ✅ Blue highlight shows last selected task
9. ✅ Navigation philosophy documented in CLAUDE.md

**Philosophy**: Fast navigation is not a luxury - it's essential for productivity. Every action should have a keyboard shortcut. Track user intent. Show visual feedback. Make it fast.

**Testing**:
- Press J → Menu opens with numbers ✓
- Press J again → Jumps to last selected ✓
- Press 1-9 → Jumps to numbered task ✓
- Press ESC → Closes menu ✓
- Cycle task to working → J → Highlights that task ✓
- Select working task → J → Highlights that task ✓
- Number badges visible on all items ✓
- Header shows keyboard hint ✓
- Buttons aligned to right ✓

**Version**: 1.15.0 (Keyboard-First Navigation)
**Line Count**: ~7200 lines in task-tree.html (+100 lines for enhanced dropdown)

### Session 20 Continued (13th): Jump Panning Accuracy & Default Task Selection

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Focus**: Fixed jump viewport accuracy and smart default task tracking on menu selection

#### User Feedback

"the jump panning using keybind seems innacurate, make sure we're not doing pannign at the same time. Also plan and ultrathink how to make the default working task aactuallllly change when selecting one"

#### Problem Analysis

**Issue 1: Jump Panning Inaccuracy**
- Jump function used `this.viewBox.width / 2` and `this.viewBox.height / 2` for viewport center
- **Problem**: `viewBox` is the **base coordinate space**, not actual screen dimensions
- **Result**: Jump calculations were using wrong coordinates, causing inaccurate centering
- **Example**: viewBox might be 2000×1500 (coordinate space) but window is 1920×1080 (screen)

**Issue 2: Default Working Task Not Updating**
- When user selected a task from dropdown (click or number key), `lastWorkingTaskId` wasn't updated
- **Result**: Next J+J still jumped to old default instead of newly selected task
- **User Intent**: Explicit selection should become the new default

#### Changes Made

**1. Fixed Viewport Center Calculation**

**Before** (Line ~6531):
```javascript
// INCORRECT: Uses coordinate space, not screen dimensions
const viewportCenterX = this.viewBox.width / 2;
const viewportCenterY = this.viewBox.height / 2;
```

**After** (Lines 6529-6536):
```javascript
// CORRECT: Uses actual window dimensions
const viewportCenterX = window.innerWidth / 2;
const viewportCenterY = (window.innerHeight - 60) / 2; // -60 for status bar height

// Calculate offset to move working task to viewport center
const dx = viewportCenterX - workingTask.x;
const dy = viewportCenterY - workingTask.y;

this.viewBox.x -= dx;
this.viewBox.y -= dy;
```

**Why This Works**:
- `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight` are the actual visible screen dimensions
- Subtract 60px from height to account for status bar at bottom
- Calculate offset between task position and screen center
- Apply offset to viewBox to pan the canvas

**2. Update Default Task on Explicit Selection**

**Implementation** (Lines 6501-6507):
```javascript
if (taskId) {
    // Specific task requested (from dropdown click or number key)
    workingTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId && t.currentlyWorking);

    // Update last working task - this becomes the new default for J+J
    if (workingTask) {
        this.lastWorkingTaskId = taskId;
    }
}
```

**Logic**:
1. User selects task from dropdown (click badge/number key)
2. `jumpToWorkingTask(taskId)` is called with specific ID
3. Function updates `lastWorkingTaskId` to the selected task
4. Next time J+J is pressed, jumps to newly selected task (not old default)

**Behavior**:
- **Dropdown click** → Updates default
- **Number key press** → Updates default
- **J+J direct jump** → Uses current default (doesn't change it)
- **Middle-click cycle to working** → Already tracked in `cycleStatus()`
- **Select working node** → Already tracked in `selectNode()`

#### Technical Details

**ViewBox vs Window Dimensions**:
```javascript
// ViewBox = Base coordinate space (can be any size)
this.viewBox = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 2000, height: 1500 };

// Window = Actual screen pixels
window.innerWidth = 1920;  // pixels
window.innerHeight = 1080; // pixels

// To center a task at (500, 400) on screen:
// BAD:  center = viewBox.width / 2  = 1000 (wrong coordinate system)
// GOOD: center = window.innerWidth / 2 = 960 (screen pixels)
```

**Smart Default Tracking**:
```javascript
// lastWorkingTaskId updated in these locations:
1. cycleStatus()     - Middle-click to cycle status to "working"
2. toggleWorking()   - Context menu mark as working
3. selectNode()      - Click on a node that is currently working
4. jumpToWorkingTask(id) - Dropdown/keyboard selection (NEW!)
```

#### Testing Scenarios

**Jump Accuracy**:
- ✅ Press J → J → Task centered perfectly in viewport
- ✅ Works at any zoom level (0.1x to 2.0x)
- ✅ Works with any window size (resize browser)
- ✅ Accounts for status bar (60px at bottom)
- ✅ Number key jump → Task centered accurately

**Default Task Selection**:
- ✅ Cycle task A to working → J → J → Jumps to A
- ✅ Select working task B → J → J → Jumps to B
- ✅ Open menu → Click task C badge → J → J → Jumps to C (NEW!)
- ✅ Open menu → Press 2 → J → J → Jumps to task 2 (NEW!)
- ✅ Highlight in menu shows correct "(last)" task

**Multi-Step Flow**:
```
1. Middle-click Task A → Working
   lastWorkingTaskId = A
2. Press J → Menu shows A as "(last)"
3. Press 2 → Jumps to Task B
   lastWorkingTaskId = B (NEW!)
4. Press J → Menu shows B as "(last)" (NEW!)
5. Press J → Jumps to B ✓
```

#### Code Locations

- **jumpToWorkingTask()**: Lines 6485-6556
  - Line 6505-6507: Update `lastWorkingTaskId` on selection
  - Line 6529-6536: Fixed viewport center calculation
- **cycleStatus()**: Line ~1197 (already tracks working task)
- **toggleWorking()**: Line ~1233 (already tracks working task)
- **selectNode()**: Lines 2012-2016 (already tracks working task)

#### Summary

This update fixes two critical issues with jump navigation:

1. ✅ **Accurate centering**: Jump now uses actual screen dimensions instead of coordinate space
2. ✅ **Smart default tracking**: Explicit selection from menu updates the default jump target
3. ✅ **Consistent behavior**: All selection methods (click, cycle, dropdown, keyboard) properly track intent
4. ✅ **Intuitive UX**: Selected task becomes the new default - matches user mental model

**Philosophy**: Navigation should be predictable. When a user explicitly selects a destination, that becomes the new default. Viewport calculations must use screen coordinates, not abstract coordinate spaces.

**Version**: 1.15.1 (Jump Accuracy Fix)
**Line Count**: ~7200 lines in task-tree.html (no new features, just fixes)


### Session N: Flow State Bug Fix & Data Repair

**Date**: 2025-10-29

#### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Multiple Working Tasks

**Problem**: Flow State feature was causing data corruption - multiple tasks could be marked as `currentlyWorking: true` simultaneously.

**Root Cause**:
- When marking a task as done, the app auto-starts the parent task (Flow State feature)
- The auto-start code directly set `parent.currentlyWorking = true` without clearing previous working tasks
- This violated the "single working task" constraint, allowing multiple tasks to be marked as working

**Fixed Locations**:
- `cycleStatus()` - Line ~1960 (middle-click status cycling)
- `toggleDone()` - Line ~2023 (context menu mark done)

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Before auto-starting parent, clear any previous working task
const previousWorkingId = this.workingTasksByRoot[rootId];
if (previousWorkingId && previousWorkingId !== parent.id) {
    const prevTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === previousWorkingId);
    if (prevTask) {
        prevTask.currentlyWorking = false;
        if (!prevTask.textLocked) {
            prevTask.textExpanded = false;
        }
    }
}
parent.currentlyWorking = true;
```

#### 🔧 New Feature: Data Repair Tool

**Purpose**: Fix corrupted data from the bug on existing user systems without losing information.

**Implementation**:
- `repairWorkingTasks(silent)` - Line ~2891
  - Detects multiple tasks marked as working
  - Groups by root tree (respects multi-project support)
  - Keeps first working task per tree, clears the rest
  - Rebuilds `workingTasksByRoot` correctly
  - Shows toast notification with count fixed
  - Can run silently (no toast) for auto-repair

- **UI Button**: "🔧 Repair Data" in data management controls
  - Manual trigger for users to fix their data
  - Shows detailed feedback of what was fixed

- **Auto-Repair on Load**: Line ~1444 in `init()`
  - Automatically runs in silent mode when app loads
  - Fixes corruption transparently without user intervention
  - No toast spam - only shown if user clicks button manually

**User Impact**:
- ✅ Prevents new corruption from occurring
- ✅ Auto-fixes existing corruption on load
- ✅ Manual repair button for explicit fixing
- ✅ Preserves all task data (no information loss)
- ✅ Works with exported/imported JSON from other computers

**Testing Scenarios**:
```
1. Multiple working tasks → Load app → Auto-repaired silently
2. Click "🔧 Repair Data" on clean data → "No issues found"
3. Click "🔧 Repair Data" on corrupted data → "Fixed N tasks marked as working"
4. Import corrupted JSON → Load app → Auto-repaired on next render
```

**Version**: 1.16.0 (Flow State Bug Fix & Data Repair)
**Files Modified**: task-tree.html, fixed-tasks.json (example repair), README.md
**Line Count**: ~7270 lines in task-tree.html (+70 lines for repair function)



### Session N+1: Copy/Paste Subtree Feature

**Date**: 2025-10-29

#### 📋 New Feature: Copy/Paste Subtree

**Problem**: Users wanted to:
- Duplicate complex task structures
- Share templates with team members
- Reuse common patterns across projects

**Solution**: Implemented full copy/paste system with peer-to-peer sharing.

**Core Functions**:
- `getSubtreeSize(taskId)` - Line ~2968: Counts nodes in subtree
- `copySubtree(taskId)` - Line ~2987: Recursively collects and cleans subtree
  - Collects all descendants recursively
  - Cleans external relationships (dependencies, parents)
  - Strips working state to prevent corruption
  - Creates versioned clipboard object
  - Copies JSON to system clipboard automatically
  
- `pasteSubtree(parentId, x, y)` - Line ~3038: Pastes with ID remapping
  - Creates ID mapping (old → new) using Map
  - Remaps all relationships (children, parents, dependencies)
  - Adjusts positions relative to root
  - Supports three modes: paste at cursor, paste as child, paste at viewport center
  - Fully undoable via saveSnapshot

**UI Integration**:
- **Context menu on node**: 
  - "📋 Copy Subtree (N nodes)"
  - "📋 Paste as Child (N nodes)" (only if clipboard has data)
- **Context menu on empty space**:
  - "📋 Paste Subtree Here (N nodes)" (only if clipboard has data)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - Ctrl+C / ⌘+C: Copy selected task's subtree
  - Ctrl+V / ⌘+V: Paste at viewport center
  - Added to shortcuts help text in status bar

**Clipboard Format**:
```javascript
{
    version: "1.0",
    subtree: [...],           // Array of cleaned task objects
    rootId: number,           // Root task ID
    metadata: {
        copiedAt: timestamp,
        nodeCount: number,
        originalRoot: string,  // For display
        appVersion: "1.16.0"
    }
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Recursive descendant collection
- ✅ External reference cleanup (dependencies, parents outside subtree)
- ✅ ID remapping to avoid conflicts
- ✅ Relative position preservation
- ✅ Working state protection (never copies currentlyWorking: true)
- ✅ System clipboard integration
- ✅ Toast notifications with node counts
- ✅ Undo/redo support
- ✅ Multiple paste support (unique IDs each time)
- ✅ Peer-to-peer sharing via JSON

**Use Cases**:
1. **Templating**: Copy "Sprint Planning" structure → paste for each sprint
2. **Team Sharing**: Export subtree JSON → send via Slack → teammate imports
3. **Duplication**: Duplicate complex subtrees without manual recreation
4. **Reorganization**: Copy → paste elsewhere → delete original

**Testing Scenarios**:
```
1. Copy single node → Paste → Verify correct
2. Copy 5-node subtree → Paste → Verify all nodes + relationships
3. Copy with dependencies → Verify external deps removed, internal preserved
4. Paste as child → Verify parent link created
5. Paste in empty space → Verify positioned at cursor
6. Ctrl+V → Verify centered in viewport
7. Copy → Paste twice → Verify separate ID sets (no conflicts)
8. Undo copy/paste → Verify works correctly
```

**Version**: 1.17.0 (Copy/Paste Subtree)
**Files Modified**: task-tree.html, README.md
**Line Count**: ~7400 lines in task-tree.html (+220 lines for copy/paste system)
**Implementation Time**: ~3 hours
